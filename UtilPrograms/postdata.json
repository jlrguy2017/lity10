Right in the middle of the stage stands Alter 3, waving its arms and moving up and down with the rhythm of the music, as it conducts the seven minute long piece of music.Much like other humanoid robots developed in the last few years, such as Hanson Robotics’ Sophia the Robot, Alter 3 both looks and moves like a human being. Its face is the most delicately formed body part, resting on a metal, machine-like body where all the technology can be seen working away as it conducts on the podium.“This work is a metaphor of the relations between humans and technology. Sometimes the android will get crazy, human orchestras have to follow. But sometimes humans can cooperate very comfortably,” the composer told Reuters.While Shibuya wrote the music, the android robot was in charge of the tempo and dynamics of the live performance, even adding its own electro-vocals to the mix. “The premise is that the android itself is moving according to its own will,” said its technician Kotobuki Hikaru.But how did the performance go down with the audience? Audience members interviewed both admitted that while it was exciting, “the human touch is lost.”This didn’t dampen Shibuya’s spirits though. “After my performance I felt the audience in Sharjah was a bit quiet more than Europeans, so I was worried about how they liked it. But soon after that, they showed a great round of applause,” he told Euronews Living.Android Opera Scary Beauty is part of Sharjah Art Foundation’s Sharjapan exhibition which highlights performance art and sound-based installations from Japan. The aim is to examine the interactions between nature, technology and human life in tandem.Artificial Intelligence is radically transforming the way we live, work, travel and do business in the twenty-first century. According to PwC, AI could add €14.3 trillion to the global economy by 2030, resulting in an increase in economic growth and productivity.Robots and AI will help people perform their tasks better, reducing the probability of human error. This naturally translates into the sustainability sphere in numerous ways. For instance, 59% of manufacturers are already using robotics to help them in their processes. Using robots reduces waste in production as they are extremely accurate and are scarcely prone to error.In other environmental areas, one company called SkyGrow has developed the Growbot – which plants trees at a rate of 10 times faster than a human can. The UK’s University of Bristol developed the Row-bot in order to improve their efforts of supporting climate change. It swims around in the ocean and digests pollution that is in the water, turning it into energy that can power the boat’s motor.Some US companies are even using artificial intelligence to help sort materials like plastic, paper, metal and wood separately in recycling. “The goal is to have robots do a better job at sorting garbage and reduce the contamination and health hazards human workers face in recycling plants every day,” say CNBC.While some say robots could be harming our planet due the amount of energy and materials they consume, and concerns grow over bots displacing humans in the job sector, most conclude that AI will benefit us in the long-run.“Increasing automation and smart technologies do promise sweeping changes to society”, but also come with “the potential to liberate human populations from the mundane,” reports The Conversation in its Covering Climate Now series.“If managed carefully this technological revolution has the potential to provide significant environmental benefit.”Share this article","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/48/72/04/210x136_cmsv2_4041f89f-e2bf-5d4a-b275-c4261071fb98-4487204.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df7874a3b36bc3748631a8b","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

Nearly 50 years later, Mozart re-orchestrated the work in German translation to Der Messias.  And it's Der Messias which premiered in Mozart Week in Salzburg in a production staged by American director and visual artist Robert Wilson, known as the 'master of minimalism'.Wilson is perhaps most easily recognised for Einstein on the Beach. Widely credited as one of the greatest artistic achievements of the 20th century, this rarely performed work launched Robert Wilson and composer Philip Glass to international success when it was first produced in Avignon, France in 1976.For Robert Wilson, the strict structure of Der Messias, determined by the alternation between solo numbers for the four vocal soloists (Elena Tsallagova Soprano, Lucile Richardot Mezzo-soprano, Richard Croft Tenor and José Coca Loza Bass) and an equal number of choral sections, is the starting point for a staged performance that works with surreal images and attempts to create a vessel for the music.“What can I do to give space to the music? If I close my eyes, I begin to hear in a more concentrated way.\" he says. \"So can I create something on stage with my eyes open that'll help me to hear better?”Rolando Villazón is the artistic director of Mozart Week. He compares Mozart's Der Messias to a painting.  He says he loves how Mozart moved the oratorio from the Baroque to the classical period.  “It’s as if a painting develops (into something new), a painting which shows numerous facets,\" he explains. \"As if we walked through an enormous painting, as if we entered it and saw how the light changes.”At the end of the 1700s, Mozart accepted a commission to adapt Handel’s “Messiah”.  Salzburg’s famous composer changed some of the pitch and replaced certain instruments.  He invented rich woodwind parts, filling out the contrapuntal structure contrived so ingeniously by Handel with new colours.“Mozart put together a more symphonic orchestra,\" says conductor Marc Minkowski.  \"He also added light -  it's as if Van Gogh had painted the Mona Lisa. Indeed, as if a painter added colour by using different harmonies.\"  Robert Wilson agrees.  “The beautiful thing about Mozart's music is that there's light that brings hope.”Mozart’s Der Messias will be shown on July 24th and July 26th at the Salzburg Festival and on September 16th, 18th and 19th at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées, Paris.","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/44/38/74/210x136_cmsv2_d79af6c2-a744-5615-a4b8-d191d3ad1e55-4443874.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df7874a3b36bc3748631a8b","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

But it marches to its own tune.","content":"The Vienna Philharmonic has premiered numerous masterpieces in its 178-year history and been under the baton of the most important maestros.But it’s the New Year’s Concert which made the orchestra world-famous – with the performance being broadcast to more than 90 countries around the world.Latvian maestro Andris Nelsons, who was chosen to conduct this year’s concert, told Musica why he believes the orchestra is so special.“It's one of these orchestras where the identity is very clear and particularly when the Vienna Philharmonic play the New Year's Concert, I think that's the way that nobody plays. That is the DNA of this orchestra.”Besides polkas and marches, the orchestra has a unique way of playing the waltz.Horn player Wolfgang Vladar explains: “The second bar comes too early and the third a bit too late. You can’t explain it mathematically. You learn how to feel it.”Vladar is proud of the Vienna Philharmonic’s style.“When you listen to an American orchestra, they play it evenly. It’s almost as if they played another piece. They play very well - but they don’t have the feeling for it. Like when we play Gershwin.”Trombonist Johann Ströcker says Vienna made the music of Strauss famous and the city has a real understanding and feeling for it.“This ‘reading between the lines’ of the music is very natural to us here,” he said.Some say the orchestra’s sound is unmistakable. This might be because of its very distinct instruments.“The Viennese timpani are made of goat skin and therefore have a dark and warm sound,” says percussionist Anton Mittermayr. “It’s like, how shall I put it into words, a good and heavy red wine.”In other orchestras, timpani are made of plastic or calf skin.Other instruments are custom-made as well, including the oboes, triangles and horns.Vladar says the Viennese horns may sound very loud, but in reality they aren’t as loud as the modern double horns used in other orchestras around the world.“That is an advantage playing in an orchestra. We won’t drown out the woodwinds or the strings even if we played very loudly. The music stays more transparent.”Nelsons was a popular choice with the orchestra, which doesn’t have a permanent conductor.“He’s very connected with the orchestra,” says Vladar. “He behaves more like one of us than being the absolute ruler in front of us.”","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/40/28/22/210x136_cmsv2_f8c0373a-67a8-5eae-a266-9cc908e5b27d-4402822.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df7874a3b36bc3748631a8b","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

Written when Bellini was just 26-years-old, Soprano Sonya Yoncheva casts her spell on yet another strong female character – the heroine Imogene.Her tragic lover Gualtiero is passionately portrayed by Javier Camarena.The emotion-drenched opera pushes the human voice to its limits, and is seldom-heard because of its challenges.Yoncheva told Musica: “From the first note to the last one, it's a challenge all the time. It's vocal gymnastics. But this is what the Bel Canto is all about, right? That's why we love it. It's our most sportive discipline.\"Camarena agrees, pointing out one particularly difficult passage in the musical score. \"I think it is the hardest page I have ever sung in this opera,” he said.The story follows the tragic life of Imogene. She is in love with an exiled count, turned pirate, but she has been forced into a marriage with his worst enemy, and borne his child.\"In my life, I had the chance to be with the people I love. And she didn't have that chance. So this is her drama,\" says Yoncheva, who only recently gave birth to her second child.\"Where I can really understand her is that she has a child and this is a huge responsibility.\"In the final pages of the opera, Imogene descends into madness. Her final aria is a highlight of the performance. \"She comes with a big, enormous black curtain, dragging all the suffering that she has had during her life,\" says Stage Director Emilio Sagi, \"The thing that fascinated me is this gothic sense of the suffering and this excess of sentimentalism.\"  It’s emotional for Yoncheva, too.\"When I first listened to this aria I still have goose bumps. I was so touched by this music. This moment of calm music but knowing that she's totally crazy, this is totally irresistible.\"Performances of Il Pirata run until December 20th","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/32/72/90/210x136_cmsv2_bbdee6bf-22d6-5349-a4ca-b843ed22f9b0-4327290.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df7874a3b36bc3748631a8b","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

You can also imagine a city in itself, a psychological space. It’s a Sigmund Freud-space.”“That bathroom is up on the top of the other building. And Paul is downstairs. It creates this feeling like you're in a dream and you cannot reach something even if you feel that you can, because it's not that far away,” says Baritone Andrzej Filonchyk.The exceptional work has a difficult score written when the composer was just 23 years old, as director, Nikolaus Bachler explains:“Technically speaking it’s almost unfeasible what the tenor has to do in the first act.”Jonas Kaufmann, who sings the tenor part agrees:“I think it’s partly because of Korngold’s young age that he didn’t know how far he could go (where the limits of the voices are). All that he had in mind, all these incredible changes of harmony and rhythm. It’s a crazy maze made up of different styles.”Expressive sounds, finesse and psychedelic melodies, the opera challenges a maestro.“Listen to the orchestra pit and watch what is happening there! It’s something you will hardly find anywhere else. Especially with such a difficult oeuvre. How Kirill Petrenko partly dissects it but without ever losing the poetry,\" says Bachler.\"At the same time, there are these contradictions, these breaks and these surprising flashes which almost bring us back to Hitchcock.”After a nightmarish trip into the depths of his mind, Paul kills Marietta, but only in his dreams.But can he finally move on?“I think that this is a nice idea to leave it unknown or unclear.

My dad is old, he is retired, we have financial problems. By playing music and focusing on an orchestra, it makes you let go. Music is so extraordinary that anything is possible.”Flórez says the mission of Sinfonía por el Perú is “to improve and transform society with the power of music”.\"There are a lot of personal stories. There are kids telling me how difficult their lives are. Some of them want to stay there and even sleep in the orchestra.”More than 8,000 children throughout the country practise almost every day for several hours in one of 26 music schools, called núcleos, created especially for the project.\"The núcleos are shelters, they are oases of peace, oases of happiness and hope,” said Flórez.Striving for musical excellence, the main youth symphony orchestra is led by artistic director Hugo Carrio.He said: “When we really look into each other's eyes, and we see that the music and the energy flows between us, sometimes we cry, sometimes we laugh – these are magical moments and the children are the most important thing in my life.”In July, the orchestra performed before a crowd of nearly 20,000 in Lima’s main square.It was a dream come true for the young musicians – and their mentor Flórez.\"Now I know that music can be a life changer for the poorest and most disadvantaged kids,” he said.\"My dream with Sinfonia is that it continues to grow. I would like to get to one million kids. I know this sounds very ambitious but a million is my aim.”It’s hoped the orchestra will play at the World Expo in Dubai next year and at New York’s Carnegie Hall in 2021.","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/11/44/58/210x136_cmsv2_3579647c-5455-57c9-83b1-d711de8cc661-4114458.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df7874a3b36bc3748631a8b","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

It allows you to connect with that side of music that is connected to nature. All of the composers whose music we play were inspired by settings like that.”Philippe Bernhard, Artistic Director of the festival, says that it is summed up in its title: recontres, or meetings: “This concert hall is unique; it was made entirely of wood and has a forest of silver birches on stage.\"A tribute to a legendary cellistLa Grange au Lac was built by the visionary architect Patrick Bouchain for the legendary late Russian cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, who curated the festival for years.Patrick says that Msistlav considered the venue his home, “he always used to say, “my dacha”. Part of the magic is that you are surprised when you open the door and find yourself standing inside. It's a little bit like being in a circus. Another part of the magic is the ceiling in the shape of an ear of corn.”“I decided to surprise Rostropovich and to create scenery with the tree that represents Russia, the birch. And when you enter the building it has the scent of the forest and that immediately makes you at one with the forest.”Celebrating BrahmsJohannes Brahms, the iconic composer of the Romantic period, is the focus of this year's programme.Gustavo says Brahms is the god of this music tradition, “playing his 4th symphony is like entering a cathedral.”Sinfonia Grange au LacThe unique orchestra created for the festival has been named after the venue as Sinfonia Grange au Lac and it brings together exceptional musicians.Philippe says it is very special, “it is composed of musicians who come from different ensembles and different countries and who get together here. Once they are with Gustavo Dudamel, they click immediately. Gustavo loves the fact that the orchestra feels like family and that at the same time it's fresh. These are musicians who are incredibly open and receptive. It think it makes for a very worthwhile exchange and exprience. When they get together, you don't feel the personalities of the different orchestras they have come from.

To continue be connected and attached to life.” Wasfi explains. To do it at [a war-torn] spot was to turn every element in life into a theatre, acting in full connectivity against radicalisation and against terror.”The 47-year-old has performed at approximately 25 destroyed sites, including Mosul, which suffered an attack in 2017 by the so-called Islamic State.The strike blew up the Al-Nuri mosque along with its 850-year-old leaning Al Hadba minaret.According to Wasfi, music is an essential tool for empowerment and engagement in society.He believes that the younger generation shouldn’t appreciate the art form passively, but instead consider it a catalyst for positive leadership and a brighter future.“At the societal level, at the community level, education and enlightenment is the only empowering driving force behind preserving a momentum,” he says.Wasfi adds that, despite war and its aftermath, culture will always be present and active in the Middle East region.“Culture will never die in Iraq,” he says. “Or even in the region, where there is a rich history of civilisations, of shared cultures, and exposure to other cultures of integration.”With his Peace Through Arts Global Foundation, Wasfi plans to continue to create lasting change, fighting for his ideals whilst spreading his message of positivity worldwide“When this area dries out of oil, we can flood the whole world with culture,” he says.Palestenian cellist Naseem chose an historic setting for his first music video.My first music video is Out!!!

{"_id":{"$oid":"5e6fc8a31460b7afc9ff25d3"},"title":"\n                      The two layers of Western society ǀ View\n                  ","description":"Should Western culture (its ways of life, its traditions as developed from the past) be central in the West?","content":"Behind Yaluk Yildiz’ excellent article about populism lays a more general problem, which has haunted multiculturalism, liberalism and populism since their birth, a structural problem of the West which goes back some two ages and which has implications for both politics and culture – culture in the sense of the way in which people live their lives and how they inherit or create their identity.The more worrying populist development in the West is the emergence of rightwing extremism which practices 'white identity politics' and thinks that 'the West' should consist of homogeneous white ethno nations. One thinks of the 'AltRight' movement, born in the USA, or the 'identitarian movements' in Europe. Totally ignorant of the nature of Western civilisation, these people imagine that they defend it by undermining its greatest achievement: the formulation and upholding of universal civilisational values, creating a framework of rights and laws whereunder different cultures can live together in peace and mutual respect.Civilization is the framework of values protecting individual freedoms, rule of law, and the free movement in public place, all based upon the dignity of the human being, entirely independent from ethnicity and ways of life. This latter notion falls under the definition of 'culture' in its anthropological sense: the way people live, their customs, how they experience their identity, and the way in which they form their communities. Also the arts fall under this description of culture as an important tool of identity formation.The civilisational value framework is mainly abstract and based upon ideas as developed in the Enlightenment (18th century), and appeals mainly to the intellect: it is a collection of rational ideas and ideals, and not something based upon direct practical experience on the ground. Culture however is mainly an emotional thing, since ways of life are being transferred from generation to generation, and form the bonds between people and create the nature of communities. Culture, the arts, traditional ways of life, the way how people deal with each other in practice, their identity in many forms, all this is mainly emotional in nature. This means that the overall framework is the decisive structure which garantees peace in societies and which makes it possible that - especially in the megacities - very different people can live in the same public space and can deal with each other without problems, with freedoms limited by the freedoms of other individuals, and public space strictly protected by the rule of law.Everywhere in the world where circumstances develop to economic levels where people can begin to think about how to live better, more dignified and more meaningful and fulfilling lives, the influence of these universal values begins to be felt. Such value frameworks can be created over every type of culture, and we see this happening on many different places on the planet. Also we see the frictions that these two layers of society create, from which only one conclusion can be drawn: where culture conflicts with an overall civilisational value framework, it has to adapt to the requirements of the framework - the alternative would be the destruction of the only value structure that garantees peace and development. In practice this adaptation to the overall value framework means for instance that, in the West, religion is a private matter, and that certain aspects of religious world views which claim power over the framework, have to be dropped and considered no longer compatible with the modern world and modern, Western civilisation. Rightwing extremists who want to 'defend the West', don't understand how non-Western people and cultures are Westernised by adaptation to the overall civilisational framework and thus, become Western, while still being able to maintain meaningful elements of their non-Western culture.This civilisational framework, as developed in the 18th century (the Enlightenment movement), was immediately criticised by German philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder, who claimed that all those ‘beautiful’ ideas with their abstract ideas completely ignored the reality of people's culture and traditions, and that these abstract ideas were inevitably of the same nature as local ideas about society everywhere in the world - in other words: they don't formulate universal values. The question whether there exist universal values has since been a subject of debate and in the last century got renewed energy in the perspective of cultural relativism: any idea about society or culture has equal value and there is no universal value as if considered outside of any cultural sphere, there is no 'archimedean point of view' outside our own culture and tradition. But practice shows that this is not true: people are, in terms of their most important needs - be them physical or psychological - the same everywhere, in spite of differences on the surface of ethnicity, culture or traditions. In other words: what binds people together is profoundly universal, and their differences are relative surface phenomenae. To have discovered this distinction, is one of the greatest achievements of Western civilisation and thus potentially a basis for a world civilisation, which could put an end to war, poverty, destruction of the environment, - in short: the necessary tool for humanity to survive its own inadequacies.The value framework of the West is thus universal in nature and on another level than culture, which can only exist in harmony with the framework: the ‘umbrella structure’ that protects culture underneath. Therefore the best defence against rightwing, destructive populism, is education, where this two-layered structure is made understood - both within the West and elsewhere.This leaves one question unanswered - which is the source of so much rightwing extremism: should Western culture (its ways of life, its traditions as developed from the past) be central in the West? Because under the universal value framework, it cannot have a higher position than any other culture since the equality of different cultures is a condition of living in peace together. Here we have the problem of people in Europe getting worried that the quarter they live in, begins to look like Tunis. An answer could be found in the theoretical question: should Indian culture be dominant in India? Or should it only exist in some abstract, international thought cloud? To disconnect a culture from its local roots, is violating its energies and inspiration, much of which come from history. So, indeed, Indian culture should be central in India: it would be absurd if the overall framework would cut culture's roots, since it should protect and preserve the different cultures under its roof. From which it follows that under the umbrella of a civilisational value framework, as a compromise, local cultures should be protected from erosion, and indeed should be central. But that does not mean that they cannot be surrounded by other cultures, as Western-style cultural elements are also present in India.This compromise has implications for the way governments support identity-building activities like the arts: in an egalitarian world view, which is an extreme form of the Enlightenment universal value framework, it seems to be unfair to give priority - in the context of a Western society - to something like classical music over the financial needs of rap, musicals or pop groups, forms of culture with a much greater and wider appeal than the 'difficult' art of the concert hall. For instance, where the symphony orchestra is no longer the cultural centre, in its aspirational symbolism of a civilised community, the universal framework has cut the roots of culture instead of protecting it from erosion.From all of this follows that the development of a universal civilisational framework has an inbuilt paradox, which makes it necessary to be treated with caution and nuance. Only a balance between the framework and the cultures it is supposed to nurture and protect, can the framework have a constructive function; where it impairs the cultures under its roof, its own viability becomes undermined, and it will provoke extreme instinctive reactions which want to destroy it, because Enlightenment as a mere abstract idea stops to be a civilisational one.It will be clear that in the search for a right balance between the two layers, there can never be room for extremism of any kind, as there can be no room for a destructive abstractionism which destroys the spiritual sources of cultures.John Borstlap is a classical composer and an author on cultural subjects.Visit his website: www.johnborstlap.com____________Are you a recognised expert in your field?

For the first time, the Danish-French soprano and 2016 Operalia-winner is performing in Jules Massenet’s 'Manon' at the Zurich Opera House - together with star tenor Piotr Beczala.","content":"Childish, narcissistic or a femme fatale? 'Manon' is one of the most dazzling figures in the opera world, and now she is being played by the talented young singer Elsa Dreisig in a production by Floris Visser.It is a career jump for 27-year-old Elsa Dreisig. For the first time, the Danish-French soprano and 2016 Operalia-winner is performing in Jules Massenet’s 'Manon' at the Zurich Opera House, playing the title character.She is performing alongside Polish star tenor Piotr Beczala, who plays the Chevalier des Grieux.Speaking to Euronews, Dreisig said it is a vocal and acting challenge.She said: \"I experiment with it my way, like a painter taking a canvas and trying to create his artwork. For me, it's the same. I really wanted to find out who would come out of me. At 27-years-old, at this time of my life, which Manon is going to come out?\"The opera is based on the controversial French novel 'Manon Lescaut' (L'Histoire du chevalier des Grieux et de Manon Lescaut) by Abbé Prévost, which was first published in 1731, before it was promptly banned.The story follows two young lovers, the Chevalier des Grieux, and Manon Lescaut, who run away to Paris together. But, when they start to run out of money and Des Grieux can no longer satisfy Manon's luxurious tastes, Manon leaves him for a richer man in an attempt to climb the social ladder.Since launching at the Opéra-Comique in Paris in January 1884, the opera is frequently performed in venues all around the world.But, Elsa Dreisig promises to put a new spin on the character of Manon.“Each act is different. The first one is still very infantile, naive and light, but little by little the drama advances and one has to feel that throughout the character evolving. And then suddenly there are moments where you not only have to find drama in your voice, but also have to sing very high coloraturas,\" she said.It is all part of the vision of Dutch stage director Floris Visser, whose minimalistic production matches well with Massenet's romantic masterpiece, but also poses a question about Manon's mental state.“There is one suitcase left in the train station - and she takes it. There is no moral boundary for her not to look in the suitcase. And that makes her a typical borderliner. It’s those kinds of things, like the lack of morale. The more and more the evening develops the more and more you see that this behaviour is not that of somebody who is just naive. It’s the behaviour of somebody who is actually ill.”Dreisig's co-performer Piotr Beczala compared Manon with the title character from the classic French opera 'Carmen', a femme fatale who seduces men and leads them astray.\"[She is] a young girl who is different and doesn’t fit in within society. She’s far too curious for her time.”But, a key part of the performance is the on-stage relationship between Dreisig and Beczala, who took home the award for Best Male Singer at the International Opera Awards in London in 2018.“It’s almost a devilish seduction. And I try to play it like that, my despair is so huge. Actually, he’s lost from the beginning.”_You can buy tickets to see 'Manon' through the Zurich Opera House's website._","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/77/04/16/210x136_cmsv2_9c38b522-e5c0-594c-bb47-b7a5b1993af7-3770416.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df7874a3b36bc3748631a8b","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

Musica caught up with her during one of her most recent performances of Maurice Ravel's Piano Concerto in G in Los Angeles.French connectionConducting Grimaud and the LA Philharmonic was Frenchman Lionel Bringuier. Immersing the Walt Disney Concert Hall in a kaleidoscope of sound, the fact that a dynamic French pianist, under the baton of a French conductor, was playing a concerto written by one of the great French composers was a notable coincidence not lost on anyone. For those watching, that French connection and Los Angeles as a venue seemed the perfect musical combination, especially given Ravel's love of jazz.\"incredible kinetic force\"\"It's a wonderful piece, it's full of vitality, it's exhilarating,\" explains Grimaud of Ravel's masterpiece. She adds: \"There is that incredible kinetic force. Ravel had the inspiration for the motive of the first movement on a train. There is that mechanical quality, but it's like a machine with a soul.\"The iconic French composer wrote the concerto after an extensive tour of the US in the late 1920s. This left a profound impression on him.\"This tour was a huge success for him and afterwards he was really influenced by jazz, all this music, he had heard here, explains Bringuier, adding: \"It's very lively and you can feel this American energy, the swing, the rhythm, and the soul.\"\"singing directly from the soul\"Describing the second movement of Ravel's concerto Grimaud says, \"You have of course this sublime second movement with this never ending melody. When you hear it, it feels as if it's just singing directly from the soul.\"Altering timeGrimaud is always pushing the boundaries, continually attempting to reinterpret her concertos and it was no different here.\"All these pieces they can accompany you a lifetime and that's what makes it also an adventure. And I think every concert should be actually approached with that spirit of adventure.\"For me the hope in a concert is to convey enough emotion to alter time,\" she says.When discussing the talent and quality his compatriot brings, Bringuier says of Grimaud: \"She plays with a lot of tenderness but at the same time there is such intensity which she is able to create in the space of a few seconds. It's always magical.\"\"Everyone comes from somewhere else\"Just like Ravel, when the versatile French artist first came to play in the US nearly 30 years ago, it was a revelation.\"As I was growing up I already had this feeling that I came from somewhere else and all of a sudden coming to the US at an early age it is almost as if that question of belonging ceased to matter...that really is what made the US feel like home because everyone comes from somewhere else,\" Grimaud says.Summing up she adds, \"And you know I always liked artistically this idea that when you leave the shore and you get to that point where you're too far to go back but you're still far away from the shore on the other side - that space in between, is a space of transformation, of metamorphosis...I think that's where you're the most likely to actually find yourself.\"","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/75/88/58/210x136_cmsv2_4196a442-5ea9-52ce-8135-b188d0f2ca88-3758858.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df7874a3b36bc3748631a8b","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

There’s nothing more reassuring than submerging myself in a steaming tub, candle flickers and soothing scents mingling with the steam around me. So upon discovering that Londoners were ditching water and instead bathing in the sounds of gongs for therapeutic benefits, I wanted in on the action.The setting for my first gong bath session is a familiar one – an airy room strewn with yoga mats at a studio in an old warehouse in South East London. Less usual though are the huge metallic discs suspended at the front of the room, glistening in tones of beaten copper, gold and black. A bearded man sits zen-like in the lotus position at their base, rhythmically pumping a boxy accordion. It emits strange humming tones that offer a ceremonial air to the occasion.We begin with some kriyas, which are breath exercises that prepare the body for deep meditation. Next we set positive intentions and then lie snuggled under a blanket in anticipation of the experience ahead.Suddenly my entire consciousness is thrumming with a sound that feels incredibly close and subtle yet also vast and distant. Like holding your ear to a conch shell and hearing the waves of all the earth’s oceans breaking simultaneously. It’s more sensation than sound, an immersive ripple of energy passing through my body and sending tingles undulating from crown to toe.From that point on, time seems immeasurable and irrelevant. I’m suspended between sleep and wake in a heightened state of consciousness that’s effortless to maintain. Surely this is what transcendence feels like, or lucid dreaming perhaps. Visions of my friends and family enter my head. An idea for a creative project I’m working on materialises suddenly. As the last remnants of sound wash away, I’m overcome with a sense of deep calm and gratitude – a refreshing perspective that’s all too often elusive in my busy life.Gong meditations have been around for thousands of years as a method of healing. Along with quieting the mind’s chatter and relieving stress, this form of sound therapy can help with anxiety, depression, trauma, pain management and chemotherapy support. “It’s a modality that bends itself to the person in the room, so it can technically help everybody,” gong master Leo Cosendai, who led our session, tells me.Cosendai discovered the powerful benefits of sound bathing after suffering from acute anxiety and panic attacks for many years. “I was rooted in a state of dis-ease. The lack of progress I was making opened me up to a whole array of practices which didn't cut the mustard,” he reveals. “Fortunately, after much time seeking what would help, my wife took me to my first gong bath. It was a total revelation. So much so that I ended up purchasing a gong three weeks later.”But how does it work? “Humans have evolved to respond to sound in certain ways, it’s linked to our survival as a species,” explains Lyz Cooper, founder of The British Academy of Sound Therapy. “With advances in neuroscience we are able to see into the brain to find out how sound affects us. Our research has shown that playing certain instruments, pitches, rhythms in certain ways helps improve health and wellbeing.”“Sound has a tremendous effect on the mind and body – it's almost like we were designed to absorb it physically and process it mentally,” Cosendai says. “Our bones are wonderful vibration transducers and we are made of over 60% water, which after having seen Emoto's work will leave most people amazed at what can go on in our body when we bathe in sound.”He references the work of Japanese doctor Masaru Emoto, who claims that sound and human intent can affect the molecular structure of water. His experiments involved freezing water that had been exposed to different words, pictures and music, and then examining the ice crystals under a microscope. The water exposed to positive speech and relaxing sounds formed harmonious geometric crystals, while that exposed to negative intention and unpleasant sounds resulted in ugly, disorderly crystals.It’s a theory that’s backed by numerous cymatics experiments on YouTube. These allow sound to be made visible – for example by sending its vibrations across a surface sprinkled with fine dust and observing the resultant patterns. “They really give you an idea of the geometry and shape of sound. It's absolutely beautiful and mind blowing at the same time,” Cosendai remarks.It creates a compelling image of what’s happened inside me. I imagine all the water contained in my body vibrating in perfect molecular formation, thanks to our positive intention setting and the beautiful immersive tones of the gongs.While I wouldn’t trade in my faithful water bath, it’s sound I’ll sink into if an internal cleanse is what I need.Writer: Kate JohnsonShare this article","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/68/22/58/210x136_cmsv2_7688df5c-6afa-533c-a98a-c54c0931bbe4-3682258.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df7874a3b36bc3748631a8b","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

(Mass of Glory) The London Symphony Orchestra together with The London Chorus recently performed the piece in the capital's Barbican Centre conducted by maestro Sir Antonio Pappano.\"It is undeniably Puccini\"\"The 'Messa di Gloria' is not a mature work but that's what I think gives it its charm,\" Sir Antonio explains before adding: \"It's an early, very early effort of his but it is undeniably Puccini.The composer goes on to say: \"Puccini came from a line of organists and choir masters but it was a voyage that he took to go see Verdi's Aida and this changed his life. Aida was something really new, with a more exotic musical language that appealed to Puccini.\"After this experience Giacomo Puccini decided to follow in the footsteps of his hero Verdi and compose only operas. This 1880 work remains the only church mass that he ever composed.\"It's like a return to my beginnings\"French tenor Benjamin Bernheim says he has a special bond with the youthful piece composed by Puccini.\"It's very funny, because this is one of the first works that I sang. I was still a baby tenor and it was my first experience as a soloist with an audience and an orchestra. It's like a return to my beginnings and I can see the vocal difference between 15 years ago and now. It's like another world,\"Bernheim says.At the core of the mass is the Gloria, which includes a beautiful tenor solo called \"Gratias agimus tibi\". Sir Antonio says: \"Would I say it's operatic. Not really. It's an in-between style. This becomes more operatic. This phrase...(starts playing the piano) that's more operatic but he does try to be liturgical, but of course in his bones he's already a man of the theatre.\"\"It finishes with a sort of smile in the music\"\"There is a lot of joy in this piece and we really try to sing it with as much delight as possible,\" explains Bernheim, who goes on to say, \"Moreover, it's a mass about glory and not a requiem. It's really something enlightened,\" adding, \"It finishes with a sort of smile in the music. We expect that something is going to happen and it's the end. It's really wonderful.\"When summing up the work by Puccini, Sir Antonio concludes by saying, \"It does seem to sort of float away. I find that charming.\"","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/69/77/04/210x136_cmsv2_f35a88bd-0436-52ad-a3a7-11b1d901a670-3697704.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df7874a3b36bc3748631a8b","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

Since the referendum in June 2016, the German embassy in London has received more than 3,000 applications from members of once Jewish German families living in the UK.Prior to Brexit, as few as 20 applications were received per year.Wallfisch’s grandmother has lived in the UK for more than 70 years and credits her survival of Auschwitz to her ability to play the cello.\"And then she asked me ‘what did you do before the war? I said I played the cello. She said ‘fantastic, you’ll be saved' — and that’s how it happened,\" Anita Lasker-Wallfsih recalls.More than 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, lost their lives at Auschwitz before its liberation by the Red Army on January 27, 1945.Following the war, Lasker-Wallfisch emigrated to the UK and swore never to set foot in Germany again.So how does Lasker-Wallfisch feel about her grandson becoming a German citizen?\"He’s a musician; he travels; he’s a European. It’s nothing to do with German — I’m not allowing the German’s to think we want to be German again, forget it…European, he is a real European.\"With his dual European nationality, Wallfisch says he’s lucky to continue playing and singing in Europe and the UK as he does today.","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/69/83/10/210x136_cmsv2_4a80fbd0-31bb-55c9-821d-a5b9e74fcdd8-3698310.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df7874a3b36bc3748631a8b","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

Laurent Pelly creates a dreamlike and mysterious atmosphere at the Vienna Staatsoper . Olga Peretyatko and Juan Diego Flórez incarnate the tragic lovers.Passion, despair and madness are at the heart of Donizetti's “Lucia di Lammermoor”. The Vienna Staatsoper, which celebrates its 150th anniversary this year, is presenting a new staging by Laurent Pelly. The great tenor Juan Diego Flórez and star soprano Olga Peretyatko are the tragic lovers in this ravishing score.The famous French Stage Director offers his intepretation of the opera: \"There is always a constant heartbeat. For me the music is full of energy and tension.\"\"The height of bel canto\"Tenor Juan Diego Flórez explains: \"It's about the singing. Of course it is also about expression and theatre, there's a lot of drama here, but the singing, is the most important, it was the height of bel canto.\"The opera from 1835 explores the despair of Lucia who loves Edgardo, but is forced into an arranged marriage that leads her into insanity and death.\"What I really wanted to avoid with Lucia is the realism,\" adds Pelly. \"For me this piece is more like a horror movie. It's a story about a young girl who is manipulated by all these men around her. She is a fragile girl, fragile psychologically.\"A unique instrumentThe Glass harmonica - a unique instrument - accompanies the iconic scene of madness that depicts the cascading elements of Lucia’s disintegrating mind.\"This is extraordinary, especially with this Glass harmonica. It has such an effect, it's transcendental. It's not at all from this world,\" says soprano, Olga Peretyatko.Exploring this intense scene, Pelly explains: \"The madness is also like a projection. She is imagining Edgardo the whole time next to her. And then there is this great moment for me which should be almost like a sensual moment. In front of all these people, she is almost miming the act of love.\"\"In the mad scene you can show all kinds of facets, different sides and show all your colours,\" adds Peretyatko.To conclude, Juan Diego Flórez explains: \"I sing this magnificent, oh my god, what a difficult and beautiful ending.\" He adds, \"If you become creative while you're singing, you can really even make it more beautiful you know...me, as a singer I can really explore different shades of expression.\"  ","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/65/99/20/210x136_cmsv2_3241aa6d-bb10-57a1-b48f-210cfcf376ca-3659920.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df7874a3b36bc3748631a8b","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

Only the greatest maestros get to conduct this legendary concert","content":"One of the greatest honours a maestro can receive is to conduct the famous New Year’s concert in Vienna’s Musikverein concert hall watched on television by some 50 million people in more than 90 countries. For German conductor Christian Thielemann this year was a first and his triumphant performance was the product of a long and fruitful collaboration with the Vienna Philharmonic.“It’s a marvellous atmosphere,” he said. “I learn a lot because it’s good for a conductor to listen to what the orchestra is offering. This orchestra in particular has it very own innate style of music. It’s incomparable and it gives me ideas because my development is nuanced by how they play. ““He sees and feels everything,” says Orchestra chairman Daniel Froschauer. “He feels when the concertmaster wants to slow down. He is so flexible he can use it in order to create another magic moment. ““We start with such an elegant Austrian march,” says Thielemann. “In general marches are quite difficult because they degenerate easily. However, not with this orchestra. Then, there’s a waltz and a fairy theme with an elfs’ round dance. So we have different sound colours. And after that, the music gets sturdy. When you listen to ‘Nordseebilder’ - pictures of the North sea - you can see a storm coming up. But although it sounds looming, it changes into a pleasing waltz. All those different parts form a kind of a hilly landscape.”.Every New Year’s repertoire includes several works from the Strauss dynasty. Despite the long tradition there are still pieces from the repertoire that can be found to be played for the first ever time at the concert for example Josef Strauss’s The dancers.“They were able to express themselves in such a beautiful way with their musical language that a huge audience loved them,” says Froschauer. “For instance The Dancers… you can literally see a dancer moving on her toes. You can hear it.”\"No wonder that Johannes Brahms wrote a dedication for Johann Strauss in which he said ‘unfortunately they’re not mine’ - referring to the first notes of the Danube Waltz. That says it all.”","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/55/50/68/210x136_cmsv2_6ef9617b-57eb-5b70-874a-2140ff195b9a-3555068.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df7874a3b36bc3748631a8b","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

Maestro Franz Welser-Möst conceived the programme, a musical journey with devastation,  hope and contemplation. The conductor said: \"I think these days of commemoration are there to pause for a moment and think about what happened. How have we evolved over the past 100 years.  \"When I chose the pieces, they were important to me. At the beginning we have this belief and this vision of humanism, followed by the horror of the war and the question of what do we do afterwards?\" the conductor added.  While the war raged, Gustav Holst composed an orchestral suite including \"Mars, the Bringer of War\".\"This piece has something intensely threatening about it. You think you can hear a whole army beginning to march,\" said Welser-Möst. The First World War showed no mercy to artists. Many died or returned injured like the Austrian pianist Paul Wittgenstein. He lost his right arm on the battlefield. Maurice Ravel composed a concerto for him - marvellously interpreted by the charismatic pianist Yuja Wang.\"The way he has written it, it's like he's had three hands or four hands in his head I mean there's a top melody and then, this in the middle, and it's like the most beautiful harmonies there and so much intricacies and the instrumentation, he's using, the colours he's creating. And you know it has a groovy, wild side,\" Wang said.   \"I think I just enjoy this kind of mysterious power inside, coming from you know like three motives and he is just constantly transforming them... and this power is probably coming from all the catastrophe from the end of the war. And I like that dark power,\" she says.  The concert ended with Charles Ives' “The unanswered question”, a final meditation.\"It's a work that deals with the question - where has the vision of humanism gone?

It makes us smile. It makes us weep. It brings us close to each other. We live in a world that all too often seems dominated by division ... it has the power to unite us in beauty and in strength”.These were words from the conductor laureate of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, Sir Andrew Davis, when he addressed the 6,000 strong audience in the Royal Albert Hall on Saturday night’s Last Night of the Proms, with countless thousands listening and watching across the globe. This year, in addition to the many Union Jacks which traditionally adorn this event, the EU flag was extremely prominent.These were offered for free to raise awareness of the plight facing UK musicians after Brexit. I supported this movement, as I am a freelance viola player who has appeared in several Proms over the last few years, most notably with Sir John Eliot Gardiner’s English Baroque Soloists, and this year performing in Handel’s Theodora with the ensemble Arcangelo. The act of giving flags was reported as a \"hijacking\", but in the context of the support that we experienced from the music lovers in the audience that feels like a misplaced description.Sir Andrew’s words will ring true for anyone who enjoys classical music. What many people don’t realize is that music is also hugely beneficial to our economy. The Incorporated Society of Musicians report that the music industry as a whole brings in £4.4 billion for our economy every year. Writing on the Musicians’ Union blog earlier this year, the Bristol West MP Thangam Debbonaire stated that music generates £2.5 billion of export revenue for the UK. Musicians are hugely concerned about losing freedom of movement. In the wake of the Proms, now is the ideal time to highlight the issues ahead and alert audiences to how Brexit stands to adversely affect classical music in this country. There is no point having these conversations in six months' time.In a poll by the Incorporated Society of Musicians, a third said that 50% or more of their income comes via work in the other EU member states. So, following the vote to leave the EU, where does this leave us?As it stands, my colleagues and I plan to undertake EU work post-Brexit. We hope that the UK achieves a deal with the EU, and we know that in this instance we will retain freedom of movement until the end of 2020, under a transition period. Currently if I am offered work with an orchestra in Paris, all I have to do is send them a form from HMRC which demonstrates my status as a UK tax payer so that they can pass my fee on to me after the gig without deducting tax in France.If freedom of movement is lost, as it is likely to be following a transition period, then things become more complicated, as they were before the UK joined the EU. With the loss of freedom of movement we will be required to provide instrument carnets, work permits and/or visas to support our touring activities. As it stands, if you tour to the USA with an instrument then you must carry a document certifying all of the materials contained within it. If the customs officials suspect that your instrument contains a banned material then it will be destroyed. Now, I accept that it is unlikely that this sort of regulation will be applied overnight on 29 March 2019. But you can understand that no instrumentalist wants to take that risk.It has been 18 months since the UK government triggered Article 50. Since then we have heard nothing about freedom of movement regarding services. Nothing. With just over 6 months until we leave that is simply extraordinary.I am involved in organizing a tour with the Oxford-based orchestra Instruments of Time and Truth. We go to Spain for a week and leave the UK on 29 March 2019, which is the day that the UK is set to leave the EU. We have to get paperwork in place for 40-50 musicians. Do we only need paperwork for our return journey? Do we need to demonstrate on our return journey that we left the UK on 29 March, even though that technically wasn’t an issue at the time? Does every member of our choir and orchestra need to apply for a work permit? We have accepted the dates so I accept that this paperwork may well need to materialize. I cannot begin to deal with any paperwork until there is some guidance available. This is a shocking dereliction of duty by our government and the uncertainty, as in so many other sectors, is not good for business.Going forward, if UK orchestras do need to generate this paperwork for tours in the EU then realistically the admin costs will need to be added on to our fee. Will a promoter in the EU want to book a UK group, or would they prefer a cheaper group from an EU member state operating without the costly burden of bureaucracy?Do EU nationals playing in the Last Night of the Proms earn the £80,000 a year required to keep their place here? Every single Prom from this year’s festival would look and sound very different if you removed each non-UK EU national from the stage.If music colleges have to charge EU nationals the rates which currently apply to non-EU countries, many will simply not be able to come. The talent pool decreases, and standards drop. How many music college professors from EU countries earn more than £80,000 per year? The UK has already lost two of its most prestigious training opportunities to Brexit; the European Union Youth Orchestra and the European Union Baroque Orchestra. The latter shaped my path into the profession and it’s a disgrace that our musicians will now miss out on these valuable training opportunities.Artistic Director of the Gabrieli Consort and Players, Paul McCreesh, sums up the situation as follows. “Let's be realistic - leaving the EU is not going to prevent the Berlin Philharmonic appearing at the Proms. Nor will concert halls and opera houses in Vienna, Paris or Madrid cease to engage the most renowned UK soloists and singers. But the axe will fall very hard on the thousands of hard-working UK-based freelance musicians in orchestras, choirs and all sorts of musical ensembles across the EU, who are likely to face drastic loss of earnings.”Going forward, I and the musicians with whom I stand are writing to our MPs, and working hard to protect our rights as performers. We ask those who would like to support us to also write to their MPs, to raise these issues. In order to maintain our place on the world stage we need to preserve freedom of movement in the EU so that we can continue to share the world-class music-making which happens in this country.I end with an endorsement from mezzo-soprano Dame Sarah Connolly DBE, “The BBC Proms season is the greatest music festival in the world.

This is done out of understanding the pain that such a hearing will generate among Holocaust survivors among our listeners,\" it explained.   The corporation said it would hold an \"ethical... and professional discussion among the professional bodies within it and will invite the public to express its views\" over the issue. However, not everyone in Israel agrees that Wagner's music shouldn't be played.Jonathan Livny, head of the Israel Wagner Society, told Haaretz he welcomed the broadcast.“We do not play the opinions of the composer, but the wonderful music he created,” he explained.","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/30/01/00/210x136_cmsv2_4983589e-ccc6-55f7-844f-7b5ff557e3c2-3300100.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df7874a3b36bc3748631a8b","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

To commemorate that slavery started around 400 years ago in the USA, she wants to bring together the musical heritage of her ancestors, like blues, gospel and jazz, and blend it with that of classical music, a music genre rooted in white European culture.Liz McComb will perform a mix of classics as well as her own songs at two concerts accompanied by a symphony orchestra in France in September. Euronews was there as she rehearsed for her new programme with the French L'Orchestre de l'Opera en Plein Air with conductor Nicolas Guiraud and pianist Cyril Barbessol.\"It’s interesting to bring this different universe of music together because blues (and) gospel are oral traditions. Jazz, soul, blues and gospel musicians improvise. Classical music musicians do not improvise. Classical music is written music and is passed on written. So, I find the confrontation of these two music worlds interesting,\" Nicolas Guiraud told Euronews.ROOTS IN GOSPELThe sixth of seven children, Liz McComb was born in Cleveland in 1952 and grew up in an African-American family that originally came from Mississippi. Her father, a factory worker, died when she was very young. Her mother was very religious, as was the whole family, and she became a preacher and the pastor of a Pentecostal church. Three of her sisters formed a vocal group called The Daughters of Zion, which was very popular in local churches. Many years later, they would sometimes accompany McComb during her concerts. McComb started singing in church at the early age of three. At home, the children grew up listening to the great gospel singers: The Staple Singers, Sister Rosetta Tharpe and above all, Mahalia Jackson, who became McComb's idol and her role model. The young girl learned Jackson's entire repertory by heart. In the meantime, her only brother played jazz trumpet and introduced McComb to the great jazz musicians - Louis Armstrong, Charlie Parker and Max Roach as well as Nat King Cole and Sarah Vaughan.McComb began with violin but decided to switch to the piano, an instrument with which her \"heartstrings feel perfectly in tune\", in her words. She learned to play the piano on her own and one day she decided to take the plunge and replace her pianist at a moment's notice. Gradually, she became one of the best pianist-singers of her generation. LOOKING FOR NEW MUSICAL CHALLENGES  Throughout her career she was always looking for new musical challenges, despite all the differences between gospel, blues, jazz and classical music, for all music is about passion, love and expressing feelings on the stage.\"They are great and they understand, music is the same - they understand that, they understand there is an approach in classical, but they understand when I do a song that is pure blues, he go immediately and play the blues, but only with the music of classical – it’s pure, its wonderful,\" Liz McComb told Euronews.Liz McComb and the Orchestre de l’Opéra en Plein Air will perform their «Symphonic Spiritual Suite» programme at the Château d'Haroué in the region of Lorraine in north-eastern France on September 2 and at the Cour des Invalides in Paris on September 9. Among the highlights are classics from Duke Ellington, George Gershwin and songs written by Liz McComb herself.","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/29/39/82/210x136_cmsv2_aea4916f-a447-5e86-942c-dcc970a0cffd-3293982.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df7874a3b36bc3748631a8b","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

We also visit a refugee camp in Jordan where traditional music is helping Syrians reconnect with their heritage.In the wake of the 75th anniversary of composer Sergei Rachmaninov’s passing, the European Union Youth Orchestra played to packed venues in the UAE, with special performances in Abu Dhabi and at the Dubai Opera.Since it first began bridging the gap between music colleges and the professional world of the arts in 1976, the EUYO has been touring cities from New York to Shanghai. The orchestra’s members are aged just 16 to 26 and they are made up of players from 28 different EU states.Inspire Middle East managed to sneak into their rehearsals and speak to Russian-born, award-winning conductor, Vasily Petrenko.Petrenko believes that the EUYO is a shining example of how bringing together different nations and cultures can be a fulfilling experience for both musicians and the general public.Furthermore, the maestro’s first trip to the UAE seemed to strike a positive personal note, with Petrenko acknowledging the country’s commitment to artistic diversity.“It’s very important that the growth of a country is based not only on economic growth but also on the cultural growth,” he said. “And the more international, more open to the world the country is, better are the benefits.”In a similar vein, Jasper Hope, the CEO of Dubai Opera, outlined that upcoming acts at the venue he curates would not only include international bands and dance troupes but also talented locals.“We're still pretty new in terms of our Arabic programming strand, but for the next show - in a couple of weeks’ time - we have a group of five Arabic indie bands,” Hope explained.“The aim is to be able to inspire local talent, irrespective of what kind of music we have on our stage,” he said. “I really hope that the next generation of Emirati stars will start to think ‘this is somewhere I have to aspire to get to’.”One of the potential challenges faced by aspiring opera singers and composers in the region is the current lack of specialist training available. Hope explained that studying overseas in world-renowned conservatoires, before joining international companies, was the choice for many burgeoning classical music artistes.That’s not to say the chief executive wasn’t optimistic that changes were afoot:“I have no doubt, at all, that one day we’ll have our own company right here in Dubai - being able to put on our own productions, rather than importing them from elsewhere.”The first dedicated opera space to be built in the Middle East and North Africa was Egypt’s Khedivial Opera House in 1869. It was erected to celebrate the opening of the Suez Canal yet tragically, just over a century later, the opera house burnt to the ground.It was not until 1988 that the Cairo Opera House was opened in the Egyptian capital, further enriching the country’s classical music scene.In the Syrian capital Damascus, a five-level opera house and performing arts space was officially inaugurated in 2004, whilst in Oman the imposing Royal Opera House has been drawing crowds since 2011.Algeria was next to add to the list of opera houses in the region, rolling out the red carpet of the Algiers Opera House in 2016.That same year, Kuwait cut the ribbon of the Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Cultural Centre, also known as the Kuwait Opera House.The region’s most recent opening was Dubai Opera, which was inaugurated two years ago with a performance by Spanish Tenor Placido Domingo. The venue’s architecture and design has been much lauded, not least for the concealed hydraulics system of the main stage, which allows it to create layouts suitable for plays, pop concerts and Broadway musicals.In the pipeline, is Saudi Arabia, with plans to construct its first opera house - situated in Jeddah - as part of the Kingdom’s $64bn entertainment sector budget for the coming decade.Soulful, traditional and alluring are words often used to describe the operatic Arab art form of ’taarab’.According to taarab performer Mustafa al Sagheer, the specific words, melodies, instruments and dress of the performances are meant to enthrall the listener and transport them from their current reality.Taarab ballads – each lasting up to ten minutes - are romantic and nostalgic poems adapted to music.When they play, performers always don traditional garb from the Ottoman period – including a shawl tied around the waist and a tarboosh hat.The Salateen Al Taarab (Sultans of Taarab) were formed in Syria in 1992. Since then they have performed all over the world from Germany to Canada – endeavouring to share their heritage through music. But geopolitical tensions in their homeland caused the group to disperse - and in 2012 the one remaining member, Al Sagheer, formed a new band with his fellow countrymen and Jordanians.Salateen Al Taarab were invited to the Azraq refugee camp in Jordan by the World Food Programme (WFP) to perform for those living there.“We came to contribute to the happiness of the people here and to make them feel that life is present and that from suffering we bring happiness,” said Al Sagheer.Nineteen-year-old Jameel, who lives at the camp, explained what it was like to witness Taarab music for the first time:“Today when I attended the guys’ performance, I felt something strange - truly, through the music, the sound, the tunes. Something very strange happened inside me. This music brings us back to the old days, to our childhood. Yes, I’m not old, but it brings me back to the old memories.”Hilal Al Balushi and Mohammed Al Jenhani of the group ‘Amouage Ensemble’ took this snap pre-performance at Muscat’s Royal Opera House.ثنائي فرقة أمواج في حفل في الأوبرا جاليريا @amouage_ensemble . amouage_ensemble dou at the Opera Galleria . #فرقة_أمواج#حفل#فعالية#الأوبرا_جاليريا#عمان#مسقط . #explore#explorer#amouage_ensemble#event#opera_galleria#oman_muscatUma publicação compartilhada por  Amouage Ensemble (@amouage_ensemble) em 4 de Abr, 2018 às 11:21 PDTAlgerian student Djellouli Hichem posted this photo from a night out with his colleagues at the opera house in Algiers.

From that, the network expanded to 300 choirs and orchestras that received awards from the Royal Swedish Academy and UNESCO.\"With devoted love and eternal gratitude to my mentor and father of El Sistema,\" wrote Gustavo Dudamel, a famed Venezuelan conductor now the director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, on Twitter alongside a photo of himself with Abreu.Abreu was born on May 7, 1939, in the small Andean city of Valera. He began his musical studies at nine and moved to Caracas to study composition.\"Abreu has given life to a musical system with which young people can be safe from the dangers of the street, of crime, of drugs,\" said Simon Rattle, director of the Berlin Philharmonic, according to the El Sistema website.Abreu's model has been followed by other Latin American countries as well as some in Europe.Dudamel has become the public face of El Sistema in recent years, often conducting free concerts in Caracas’ grimy downtown area.He has spoken out strongly in support of anti-government protests that last year rocked Venezuela for four months, leaving more than 120 people dead, including an 18-year-old musician from the Venezuela National Youth Orchestra.","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/11/10/80/210x136_cmsv2_b54acd8f-1120-5782-9a5d-8407a7c9d0fb-3111080.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df7874a3b36bc3748631a8b","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

That is what we try to do, you know, to embrace all this continent as one with music. I'm very happy to be part of this.\"  The musical love affairThe love affair between the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra and Gutavo Dudamel spans across a decade. The conductor first worked with the Vienna Philharmonic in 2007, when he was 26, and has since conducted it more than 100 times.The Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra has made few appearances in Mexico, with the most recent one taking place with Riccardo Muti a dozen years ago, and before that in 1981 with Carlos Kleiber.Dudamel said; \"This is a symphony full of lyrical sounds and the orchestra has that quality - that lyrical sound, that creamy beautiful way to phrase. Since the very beginning the connection with the Vienna Philharmonic was magic.\"\"It has been a really intense relationship. I’m very proud of that. I’m very happy to be part of that family,\" he said.Dudamel puts on spectacular show in Mexico CityDudamel, described as a 'rock-star celebrity' in Latin America, sold out Vienna's two programmes at the 1,300-seat Bellas Artes within an hour. A third concert at the 10,000-seat Auditorio Nacional was scheduled for the same time as the Academy Awards ceremony, which was of obvious interest because Mexican director Guillermo del Toro’s “The Shape of Water” was a front-runner.In a stellar performance, the Venezuelan conductor's rendition of Tchaikovsky's Fourth Symphony was particularly memorable, with its movements between darkness and light, from agitated gloom to radiant triumph.\"Gustavo Dudamel has this outstanding passion for music and rhythm\"Daniel Froschauer, Chairman of the Vienna Philharmonic, told euronews; \"The special thing about this Americas Tour is that it's the first time with Gustavo Dudamel here. It is of course something special to travel with him through Latin-America. He has this outstanding passion for music and rhythm, it's in his blood.\"He continued; \"It's as if Tchaikovsky had written this symphony for us. These melodies in the strings, but also in the solo wind and the brass section which partly alternate with each other.\"Michael Bladerer is Managing Director of the Vienna Philharmonic. He told euronews; \"I think this suits us really well. We are a very colourful orchestra.

She is known for her passion, her musicality, and the intense excitement that she brings to her performances. The concerto in Rome was part of a series of concerts to celebrate her 70th birthday this year.She says the stage is where she feels at home: \"That's my space, I feel I belong there and I can say anything that's in my soul because music is without words - passion, anger, sadness, you can do it on the violin and it goes direct to people's hearts and souls. It makes you cry in sorrow and it makes you cry in joy.\"Mr Pappano pays tribute to her artistry: \"This is a life that's been dedicated to music so her sound is one of all her experience, all the moments that she's been on stage, that's she's practiced, that she's been together with other musicians.\"In 2005 Kyung Wha Chung injured her left index finger but five years later she made an astonishing comeback, something she attributes to painstakingly learning to play the violin in her head. She explains: \"This was a blessing in disguise... I started to work things out in my head... the music is continuously going - the fingering the bowing, the phrasing, the colours, so I am working all the time. When I was young I could not do that without the violin.\"Brahms collaborated on the concerto with violinist Joseph Joachim - and paid tribute to his friend's Hungarian roots with the Hungarian-themed final movement.Kyung Wha Chung explains: \"His last movement is gypsy, zinga, so Hungarian and so I thought I have to really bring the Hungarian flavour in the last movement. When I discussed this with Pappano he got it immediately and his eyes just lit up and the way he just lived it and I just have to put the icing on the cake.\"Kyung Wha’s new duo CD \"Beau soir\" will be released on the 23rd* Sir Antonio Pappano and Kyung Wha Chung appear courtesy of Warner Classics.","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/09/40/16/210x136_22a96dbb-c28a-5832-8538-96ae4ec530c2-3094016.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df7874a3b36bc3748631a8b","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

Working with a musicologist, the duo unearthed forgotten gems, including Antonio Caldara’s aria ‘Fortuna e speranza’. “It’s a very deep and melancholy aria. We are very aware of each other. “It feels like she starts a line and I resume the conversation. Then I sing my line and she picks up from where I left off.“Cecilia Bartoli, mezzo-soprano“At that time the cello wasn’t seen as a solo instrument, but more as a continuous bass instrument. The cello was often used to create harmonic structure, to back a singer, for example. But in these arias there is much more of a dialogue and it’s the orchestra that supports us and that’s interesting for that period in time.“The cello is often described as the instrument that sounds most like the human voice... “I think it depends who is playing the cello.“  Cecilia Bartoli, mezzo-soprano“And it depends who’s singing, that’s for sure!“ Sol Gabetta, cellist“When you talk about the cello’s voice, you’re talking about Sol’s voice. It’s the voice of her soul. The way she plays her instrument, it’s like she’s singing in the most sublime way.

Until that time, the longest symphony lasted 31-32 minutes. Beethoven expanded the length of the symphony over 50 minutes. And until that time, the structure of the symphony was much simpler. I don’t want to break down with the tradition of this orchestra, but Eroica is a sort of column, it just stands for itself.‘’Gianandrea Noseda, NSO Music DirectorAs concertmaster, Nurit Bar-Josef is Gianandrea Noseda’s right-hand. In a profession overwhelmingly dominated by older men, Bar-Josef was the youngest concertmaster ever appointed to a major symphony orchestra at the age of 26. Sixteen years later, she still sees her job as incredibly rewarding, and says meticulous preparation is key.“Technically, and that’s the beauty about Beethoven, everything he wrote just sits so well on the instrument and always feels good to play and the struggle is more in the bow control, you know, creating the different sounds and dynamics that he wanted.“Nurit Bar-Josef, Concertmaster“If this truly excellent concert is a harbinger of things to come, the Noseda era is going to be a thrill ride for listeners.“—Washington Classical Review on Thursday's program w/ NosedaG</a> & <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CMWSoprano?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">CMWSoprano: https://t.co/EmusQc30SSpic.twitter.com/jjN8NKWqGPComposed in 1803, Eroica paid homage to the ideals of the French Revolution. “He wanted to dedicate this symphony – at the beginning he did – to Napoleon Bonaparte, but when he was reached by the news he proclaimed himself emperor, he just scratched the name Napoleon. There is a hole in the paper, in the manuscript. So also the marche funèbre in the second movement, is a marche funèbre considering all the big visions, the ideals he expected Napoleon to fulfill.“Gianandrea Noseda, NSO Music Director“It’s mostly refreshing to have a new music director and just sort of a new way of looking at things. The beauty of Maestro Noseda is when he steps on the podium he has this sound that he brings with him and so I feel that the sound of the orchestra is really… it’s just like bigger than life!“Nurit Bar-Josef, Concertmaster“My ambitions about NSO are very simple: just to be consistent in delivering the highest possible quality.

It was composed by the Romanian composer George Enescu and is based on the Greek mythological tale of Oedipus.This festival is one of Europe’s biggest classical music events. It is held every two years in Romania’s capital city Bucharest to honor the musician, composer and conductor who is often referred to as “the greatest musical phenomenon since Mozart” and “one of the greatest geniuses of modern music”.Jurowski is the new artistic director of the festival“He was a truly great composer and a visionary and a humanist as well,” says Jurowski.  “So I think there are two tasks, one is to raise awareness of Enescu’s music and to carry the message of Enescu and that is the message of Beethoven really: ‘Seit umschlungen millionen,’ that’s what he is saying, millions embrace yourself, become brothers and sisters.”The Romanian Raluca Stirbat, based in Vienna, Austria, is an internationally renown pianist and a real specialist in Enescu’s music. She has recorded all his piano compositions.“Of course,” says Stirbat, “the music is not easy to play and as later his compositions are as more things are complicated.  “The secret to playing Enescu’s compositions is that you have to understand and master them so well, that the audience has the feeling that you are improvising on stage. One has to lose the notion of time and space.”Joshua Bell is a Grammy award-winning violinist and conductor. In 2007 he played his Stradivarius violin unrecognised in a metro station in Washington DC. He collected more than forty dollars after 45 minutes. Here he is with his famous “Gibson Stradivarius” that he bought for a little under four million dollars.“Classical music gives us beauty and something perfect  in a way, says Bell.  “Beethoven created something that we wish the world were like, you know, we need that in our chaotic world, something which is beautifully structured and brings joy and emotions to everyone. “And its a wonderful thing for young people to have in their lives as well. I really believe, every child should be playing music, this is a big passion of mine to get more children playing music.Since 20112 Bell has been the conductor of the famous London-based chamber orchestra Academy of Saint Martin in the Fields.More than 3,000 musicians in three weeks of festival, which is packed with top-class world stars. The audience interest is impressive, the main concerts will be certainly all sold out. Under the leadership of the new artistic director Vladimir Jurowski,  the George Enescu Festival will appeal to an even wider audience.

The journey continued in Cleveland, Ohio, music city of excellence, known to many as the 'home of rock'n'roll'. Foy toured the city in the company of Laura DeMarco, a third generation Clevelander, historian and a fellow music lover.“A lot of time people think that the Rock Hall makes Cleveland a music city but we were a music city before that, and that’s why the Rock Hall is here! The world’s first rock concert was held here in Cleveland,” says Laura.One of Foy’s favourite music spots was The Grog Shop, a live music venue since 1992.The Grog Shop started as a random initiative: “We were young and dumb, didn’t have anything else to do with our lives and said: let’s open a bar!”, owner and founder Kathy Blackman told Foy.The club has opened its doors to world-famous groups like Flaming Lips, Oasis, Supergrass, Black Keys, and Panic! at the Disco. But it has also become ‘the place to play’ for up-and-coming bands.“We say that you need to be nice to us because we’ll see you on the way up and on the way down, that’s our adage”, joked the boss of the 27-year-old venue.The Grog Shop has been blessed with its location, positioned between Chicago and New York, it is a popular stop off for artists touring the big cities.“People get a really personal experience when they see their favourite band play at The Grog Shop”, says Kathy, describing the intimate stage which touches the crowd's knees.For Foy, the place has a \"killer energy\" which he experienced first-hand when he saw American band Frankie Cosmos perform their latest album: Vessel, which he “loved”.","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/57/88/02/210x136_cmsv2_a432c9e9-fd52-5c47-96ba-030751428077-3578802.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df787413b36bc3748631a89","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

Here's the silver lining | View\n                  ","description":"Wins in the Globes' major movie categories can sometimes act as litmus tests for the ceremonies that follow.","content":"By Ani BundelWhile fans and critics may have been disappointed by Sunday’s milquetoast, moralizing outcome, there’s reason to hope Oscar voters won’t repeat the same mistakes.\n        This weekend, the 2019 awards season officially kicked off with the 76th Golden Globe Awards. Last year’s ceremony coincided with the peak of the Time Up’s movement, which both organizers and participants acknowledged in words — but not necessarily in hardware. The 2019 show once again fell short of its potential, with top movie honors going to a pair of controversial upsets. But while fans and critics may have been disappointed by Sunday’s milquetoast, moralizing outcome, there’s reason to hope Oscar voters won’t repeat the same mistakes.Considered the kick-off to the major awards season by virtue of its place on the calendar, the Globes are voted on by the exclusive coterie of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (henceforth HFPA). And yet, the results rarely serve as a bellwether for the more popular and prestigious Academy Awards. Instead, the Guild Awards — Producer, Director, Writer, SAG-AFTRA — are usually more in line with Oscar voting, because most of the members are part of both voting blocks. And yet, the Globes do influence the Oscars, for better or for worse.There were nominations that looked promising this year. The Globes’ habit of dividing the movie categories the same way they divide television ones — “drama” on one side, “musical or comedy” on the other — gives it a far larger pool of nominees to work with and can encourage a more diverse winner’s circle. “Black Panther,” for instance, landed a best motion picture for drama nod, as did Spike Lee’s “BlacKkKlansman” and Barry Jenkins' “If Beale Street Could Talk.” Meanwhile, “Crazy Rich Asians” was nominated in the best motion picture for musical or comedy category. Host Sandra Oh — who made history (twice) during the telecast — correctly flagged the moment as cause for celebration.But when it came time to hand out the biggest awards, the HFPA played it safe. In the musical or comedy category, the controversial “Green Book” took home the top prize, while “Bohemian Rhapsody” won both best drama and best actor (Rami Malek.) The latter wasn’t that surprising; Malek was a superb performance trapped in a mediocre film.“Black Panther,” “If Beale Street Could Talk” and “BlacKkKlansman” were less traditional choices, perhaps, but also much more interesting. On the other hand, “Bohemian Rhapsody,” an all-white and nearly all-male biopic which stretched the truth to unnecessarily moralize about the virtues of living a conventional lifestyle is exactly the kind of film the Globes is supposed to be able to see through. To be fair, the “Rhapsody” producers seemed as shocked as anyone. Original director Bryan Singer, who is rumored to have a Harvey Weinstein-level laundry-list of whispered sexual assault allegations trailing him, walked off the set halfway through filming. No one on stage thanked him, but his presence hung over the speeches like a ghost, or perhaps Voldemort.“Green Book” too faced controversy after critics alleged it similarly stretched the truth to moralize on racial relations. The 1950s-era film about the friendship between Don Shirley, an African-American musical genius and his white, working-class chauffeur was written and directed by white people, leaving some to question its bona fides. And while supposedly based on a true story, the film felt pigeonholed into the same kind of feel-good race-relations parable Hollywood has been peddling since Sidney Poitier demanded to be called Mr. Tibbs in “The Heat of the Night. Shirley’s remaining family has decried the movie as a work of fiction made up by the chauffeur’s son, and declared they were boycotting the film.That the heavily white and heavily European HFPA chose to fete moralizing fairy tales is perhaps not surprising, but it was troubling. It did not help either that Bryan Singer, who was not in attendance, immediately took to Instagram to claim credit for “Bohemian Rhapsody’s” win. Nor did it help that “Green Book” director Peter Farrelly, lectured the audience about race relations in America in his acceptance speech, as the production’s handful of people of color were pushed to the edges of the crowd. It was left to Mahershala Ali to defend the movie from critics backstage.The Golden Globes are supposed to be where the more daring choices are made, because of their smaller, more exclusive voting bloc. Trying to pick films based on middle-of-the-road, conservative-leaning values is typically what gets the Oscars in trouble and leads to films like “Crash” winning over groundbreaking films like “Brokeback Mountain.”But it’s possible the Academy Awards will actually end-up benefiting from the Globe drama. Wins in the Globes' major movie categories can sometimes act as litmus tests for the ceremonies that follow. Consider for instance how James Franco's Golden Globes win last year gave rise to a massive backlash, derailing his nominations elsewhere and (rightly) dashing his Oscar hopes, after multiple women came forward alleging troubling sexual harassment claims against the actor. “Green Book” and “Bohemian Rhapsody” might have taken home the trophies this time, but the response to both suggests neither will have an easy time in February.Ani Bundel has been blogging professionally since 2010.

Today is not that day.On paper, “Bohemian Rhapsody” seems like it should be a fantastic film. It has a complex and wildly talented genius, cut down before his time by a plague the homophobic Western world refused to take seriously. It has the music of Queen, which is still as fresh and thrilling as when it was first written. It has casting that ranged from impeccable to inspired in the case of Rami Malek.So what went wrong? How could the story of one of the most fascinating figures in rock music descend into a color-by-numbers tale more suitable for VH1 than the Academy Awards?The answer has a lot to do with the film’s origins. The project spent nearly a decade kicking around Hollywood, with Sacha Baron Cohen attached to play the singer back in 2010. Already recognized for his singing talent in “Sweeney Todd” and at the time getting ready to co-star in the film adaptation of “Les Misérables,” he seemed a perfect fit. But after three years and little progress, Cohen walked away from the part.The problem, as he explained it, stemmed from the keepers of Queen’s musical rights, Brian May and Roger Taylor. May and Taylor — Queen's guitarist and drummer, respectively — had a very different movie in mind, one where they were the main stars and Freddie’s ordeal was something they’d overcome on the way to even more greatness. The film then languished until Rami Malek was hired to take on the part of Mercury. But Malek clashed with the director Bryan Singer; one day Singer too walked off the set and never came back.\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" reduces Mercury to just another fallen rock and roller, with no grasp of what makes his story so triumphant and also so tragic.The movie was completed by the assistant directors, and thankfully it did not end up being totally filtered through the hazy memories of Mercury’s remaining bandmates. But that doesn’t mean it’s a great film, or even a good one. In the end, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" reduces Mercury to just another fallen rock and roller, with no grasp of what makes his story so triumphant and also so tragic.Take for instance the opening vignette, where Brian May and Roger Taylor are portrayed as two dudes in a perfectly good band who take on Mercury on of necessity. In subsequent scene after scene, with managers, lawyers and record executives, Taylor and May are seen politely sitting on the couch, sipping tea, while Mercury is portrayed as a difficult diva. Not that May and Taylor disagreed with Mercury's music — they knew enough to go along with his genius. (So did bassist John Deacon, who, unlike May and Taylor, is not listed as an executive producer of the film, perhaps explaining why he winds up as an afterthought in many scenes.) The result is a movie that feels desperate to portray Taylor and May as the steady, responsible musicians who tried (and failed) to save their friend from himself.This is tragic, because Malek is so good as Mercury. Like, career-defining good. Moreover, the rest of the cast does a great job in support of Malek. You will believe Gwilym Lee is Brian May’s younger self and Ben Hardy does a great job as Taylor’s egotistic counterpart to Mercury. Only Joseph Mazzello as Deacon doesn’t always come off as believable; once he loses the early 1970s wig, though, he improves enormously. And then of course, there’s the genius stunt casting of Mike Myers as the EMI record exec who insists long-haired hooligan teens won’t rock out to the song “Bohemian Rhapsody” in their cars, a perfect homage to 1992’s “Wayne’s World” use of the song.But the acting can’t hide the film’s substantial plot flaws. As Mercury descends into drugs and debauchery, the other band members are shown looking uncomfortable and confused. They are heterosexual foils to his free-loving free spirit.Speaking of which, the film’s issues with Mercury's sexuality are glaring. Early on, Mercury is shown to bemadly in love with a woman, Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton). She is portrayed as a stabilizing influence, and during their relationship Mercury's music is great. But once Mercury starts exploring his sexuality, he starts to slip. High and in the thrall of manager Paul Prenter (Allen Leech, playing very against his best known “Downton Abbey” role), Mercury makes a series of bad decisions culminating in Queen nearly missing out on the opportunity to perform at Live Aid. In other words, the film seems to suggest that gay clubs can lead to drugs which can lead to increasingly poor choices and, eventually, AIDS. Nancy Reagan would give this film the D.A.R.E. seal of approval.Even worse, the film leads with this plotline. Mercury is shown telling the band he has HIV one week before their Live Aid performance. Even for this genre, the historical revisionism feels particularly egregious, inserted to make the other bandmates seem compassionate, yet stoic. Live Aid happened in 1985, but Mercury was not believed to have been diagnosed until 1987. The movie attempts to insist his scene-stealing performance at Live Aid was a final hurrah of glory in the face of certain death. In truth, it was just Freddie being Freddie, doing his thing on stage.That the people behind this movie are too unimaginative to understand this simple fact encapsulates so many of the problems with the film. In re-staging the Live Aid performance in full (it takes up the final 20 minutes, the movie captures what made Mercury such an electric performer. But it also throws into sharp relief how little the rest of the film understood about what made him so special.Ani Bundel has been blogging professionally since 2010.

A girl from California who found herself in 1980s Russia on the radar of the KGB and FBI for smuggling out underground Soviet music that Americans were never supposed to hear.","content":"This is a story about Joanna Stingray. A girl from California who found herself in 1980s Russia on the radar of the KGB and FBI for smuggling out underground Soviet music that Americans were never supposed to hear.The Kremlin never wanted Russian underground rock to be written or performed — and they definitely didn’t want anybody in the West to be listening to it.Rock music was a political tool in the Soviet Union, an import from the West that was deemed a threat to the system. So how did underground music go mainstream in a country that lacked freedom of expression?“So I realised that I had this ability to show the world something they hadn’t seen,” says Joanna, who is now 57 and living in Los Angeles. “We were brought up being so afraid of the evil empire and Russia.”Joanna Stingray spent most of the '80s in Leningrad with underground rock royalty. With a camera in hand, she filmed their music videos, concerts and even their nights out.Joanna pulled open the iron curtain with an album called Red Wave.Red Wave certainly was one of the first glimpses of Russian music around the world, certainly for the States.In 1983, Joanna was an LA musician who wasn’t getting anywhere at home, so she hopped on a plane to Russia looking for some adventure.Her understanding of the Soviet Union was not that much different from most Americans. She thought it was cold, grey and miserable.“And I remember thinking: Oh boy, this’ll be fun, there can’t be any rock in Russia. This is going to be a joke. Wait until they see me,” she says.To the outsider, there wasn’t real rock and roll in Russia: Everything had to go through the state or had to be approved by sensors and the KGB. But rockers made it happen anyway in cramped communal apartments, in abandoned buildings, on rooftops — there was an underground movement out of sight of the Kremlin and the KGB.“They didn’t like the way rock looked. I think they didn’t like the way that it riled up the audience. I think they thought like a lot of people did, that rock and roll led to rebellion and led to craziness.”But let’s go back to Joanna. It’s now 1984. She’s in Leningrad and about to meet Boris Grebenshchikov. Boris is a cult hero, a poet, a musician without a stage. This guy was the Bob Dylan of Russia who had fans travel the entire span of the USSR – that’s 6,000 miles, twice the distance between LA and New York — just to come and shake his hand. When Boris recorded new music and made 30 tapes, the black market would make a million of them in just a month. This guy was a legend.“I went there for a week thinking I would go and see this horrible place and never go back, and it turned out to be a place that moved me, and it grabbed me and it got me so jazzed up that I couldn’t think of anything else but getting back into Russia.”A certain mop-haired guitarist probably had something to do with that: Kino's Yuri Kasparyan. Though he and Joanna didn’t speak the same language, they soon made plans to marry. Young, crazy and in love. But before that happy day, Joanna had work to do.Over the next two years she skirted back and forth between LA and the USSR carrying donated guitars and keyboards with her, and on every plane ride back she left with recordings, lyrics and music videos of Leningrad’s top underground rock bands. She stuck all of this cultural contraband into the soles of her shoes and linings of her coats. Red Wave would soon become a hit in the US.It seemed like Joanna was helping to build a cultural bridge between the US and Russia. Young Americans watched the Red Wave music videos and thought ‘hey, these guys look like rockers here’.Joanna set a wedding date and bought a dress, but then, of course, this happened.“A Telex came back from Moscow that said ‘Moscow is not expecting Joanna Stingray’.“It was a message sent from them that was ‘here’s your payback for making that record’.”Joanna was labelled by the Soviet Union as an enemy of the state. She couldn’t go back to marry Uri and the following months were agonising. Her star had risen but she was punished for it. She took her case to the national press.“No isn’t a word that’s in our vocabulary in terms of this problem,” she says on an unnamed TV show, “we know it could be difficult, it could take a lot of time but it’s gonna happen, somehow we’ll make it happen.”And sure enough it did happen. Joanna is not entirely sure how, but she thinks her enemy status was revoked as an act of goodwill between America and Russia. Gorbachov was supposedly a fan of rock music and a copy of Red Wave’s album made its way to his desk.So she returned to Leningrad and Joanna and Yuri had their rock-and-roll, fairytale Russian wedding.Things changed quickly after that. It was the time of perestroika and glasnost: change and openness. Indie record labels began popping up in Russia. Leningrad’s rockers went from risking arrest to playing sold out shows all over the country.They used music to help crack open the USSR to the rest of the world, and ultimately, that made the cold war just a little bit warmer.","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/17/91/80/210x136_cmsv2_3ac7cd66-5eae-59f1-aa37-d2e58b7a4f79-3179180.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df787413b36bc3748631a89","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

I think our songs fit into where we are at the moment.\"The band also have serious issues with Britain, over bombings and Brexit.  \"We're not quite at Hungary levels of suppression. I don't think we ever will be. I don't think it is the kind of country that would take that,\" said Lockey.\"But, saying that,\" he added, \"it's the same country that bombed Syria without any authorisation from parliament and is leading the country into its worst decision in generations.\"  Lockey is the guitarist behind the riff that gives power to 'the song 'Hallelujah (So Low)'. Editors frontman Tom Smith wrote the lyrics after a visit, with Oxfam, to a Syrian refugee camp in Greece. It resonates with the fans.  \"Tom had certain feelings about his trip and wrote some lyrics to go along, reflecting on those feelings,\" explained Editors drummer and founder Ed Lay.   \"And something quite magical happened when Justin came up with this huge guitar riff. It doesn't instantly relate to refugee camps but we capture the moment in that room and that's the way the best songs come out.\"'Darkness at the Door' is the third single from the album.  On tour, the new material has gone down well, even the latest more electronic songs.\"The new stuff, I think, is sounding mega,\" said Lay. \"It feels that people are really responding to it. \"Bringing Blanck Mass in was something that we have never done before. He's a really heavy electronic producer and something that we were listening to and thought could work very well with our brand of music. Luckily, he was up for it and we created some pretty decent results.\"  The Euronews-Editors chat came just a few days after the death of young Swedish DJ and producer Avicii, which has revived the debate about the pressure faced by artists in the music industry.  \"The pressures are there. The pressures are very real,\" said Lay. \"The temptation to alleviate that pressure by taking drink or drugs or doing things that are not necessarily the best for you, is always there, of course.\"  \"It is not suprising when you hear of musicians passing away young,\" Lockey added. \"The pressure and the mental health of musicians is something that is never talked about. It's something that is always brushed under the carpet because it is not very glamorous. It's not very sexy to talk about it.\"  After a first leg of European shows, Editors have taken 'Violence' on tour to the US.But they'll be back in Europe in time for the summer festival season. The band's concerts then include the BST Festival in London's Hyde Park on Saturday 7th July when they will be among the special guests of their musical ancestors, 'The Cure,' celebrating their 40th anniversary.","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/14/30/32/210x136_cmsv2_0ad67ee4-f5d6-5cfb-9458-ac1fba605ea9-3143032.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df787413b36bc3748631a89","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

The two were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2009. Taking over from Sambora, guitarist Phil X found he had big shoes to fill.“The biggest challenge was the first couple of shows when you saw the ‘Where’s Richie?’ signs in the audience,” he says. “But then the ‘Phil X’ signs started to pop up.

Named after the best-selling Meat Loaf album, it is the brainchild of Grammy-award winning record producer and composer Jim Steinman, who has been working with Meat Loaf for almost half a century. Dozens of motorbikes lined the streets outside the historic London venue, revving their engines in chorus to officially welcome the show to the West End. One of the best-selling artists of all time, Meat Loaf attended the launch, and paid homage to Andrew Polec, the young actor who plays the lead role of Strat in the musical. “When you’re walking into an audience that already knows the songs… they’re going to automatically relate it to me. So what his job is is for them to forget me, to put me out of the picture. I no longer exist. The only person that exists, singing that song, is Strat, is Andrew. And leave me out. I no longer exist,” he said. ‘Bat Out of Hell: The Musical’ is a tale of teenage love, youthful rebellion and rock’n‘roll. It tells the story of the eternally young Strat and his gang, who roam the streets of a post-apocalyptic Manhattan. One day, Strat falls in love with Raven, the daughter of the city’s tyrannical ruler, and decides to free her from her father’s clutches. As well as some new songs written especially for the show, it features seventeen of Meat Loaf’s greatest hits.  “When Meat Loaf sang them, he was able to relate to everyone in an audience with the story that he was telling and with his incredible amount of focus and his incredible voice and talent and everything. And I guess to be receiving that torch and carrying it on and continuing to tell this story that relates to so many people is just a gift beyond a gift. So I’m very honored,” said Andrew Polec. Nearly half a century in the making, Jim Steinman’s ‘Bat Out of Hell: The Musical’ plays the Manchester Opera House next February before its world premiere at the London Coliseum from June.","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/348994/210x136_348994.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df787413b36bc3748631a89","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

Ever the chamaleon, he changed his look and music style","content":"David Bowie took up many striking and unique personas during his five-decade long career. Ever the chamaleon, he changed his look and music style time and time again. He also moved quite a bit, working in the UK, the USA and Germany. It’s his time in Berlin that is widely considered to have been his most creative.Following news of his death, fans gathered in front of Bowie’s former Berlin home in the Schoeneberg district, where he lived and worked from 1976 to 1979. Bowie had moved to Berlin to clean up his cocaine addiction and revitalise his career. He was interested in the burgeoning German music scene and, together with his flatmate Iggy Pop, he started working with Brian Eno at the famous Hansa Studios near Potsdamer Platz, where they recorded the so-called ‘Berlin Trilogy’, made up of the albums ‘Low’ (1977), ‘Heroes’ (1977) and ‘Lodger’ (1979).Heavily influenced by German bands like Kraftwerk and Neu!, ‘Heroes’ reflected the zeitgeist of the Cold War, symbolised by the divided city. At the time West Berlin was a creative melting pot of Germany’s avant-garde music scene. The ‘Berlin School’, a style of electronic music, and the Punk and New Wave influenced ‘Neue Deutsche Welle’ emerged there in the 1970’s. Inspired by Bowie’s music, British musician and producer Mark Reeder moved to West Berlin at the end of the Seventies: “You know, he presented this single ‘Heroes’, his first track on his friend Marc Bolan’s TV show. And it was like, I saw this TV show and I was at home watching this and I just couldn’t believe this. ‘What is this new David Bowie song?’ It sounded completely different to anything else,” explains Mark Reeder. “And you know, the actual period of David Bowie living here, working here, making three albums, set a kind of precedent for other artists. It meant something to come to Berlin at that time, you came to Berlin to have your Berlin period.“He got to Berlin and saw it was different, because it was full of artists and full of transvestites and full of weird people who didn’t fit in to normal society, and I think he really enjoyed his time here. It was really important for him, because he could be himself, he could find himself. David Bowie in Berlin, it was like a journey of self discovery,” says Reeder.Bowie came back to Berlin in 1987 where he gave a concert on the Western side of the Wall as part of a three-day event, which also included performances by Eurythmics and Genesis. Hundreds of young East Germans gathered on the Eastern side to listen, shouting ‘The Wall must go’. Eventually, the East German police cracked down on those getting too near the forbidden no-man’s-land. Hundreds were taken into custody. Two years later, the Wall came down.Bowie albums have been flying off the shelves since his death was announced, and his latest, ‘Blackstar’, looks set to become his first ever number one in the US.  “There are some rarities that will go up in value, I guess, you know the German version of ‘Heroes’, that’s always been a very collectible single, and that will go up in value, certain things will. Ηis new album will come out in clear vinyl, in America, and also via his website. That will go up in value, that will be very collectible,” says Nigel House, founder and co-owner of West London’s historic Rough Trade retail store. “The singles he did, or the album — I think he did a coloured vinyl album for the exhibition at the V&A — I mean that’s bound to go up in value, but his general back catalogue, no, I don’t think it will go up in value.”In the video of his latest single ‘Lazarus’, released just days before his death, Bowie can be seen lying in a hospital bed with bandages over his eyes – a haunting video carefully crafted by the iconic artist as a final parting gift to his fans.","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/321209/210x136_321209.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df787413b36bc3748631a89","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

The album is suitably otherwordly and intriguing, befitting an elusive pop star who rarely gave interviews, and whose scant public pronouncements were treated as major events. Bowie is considered one of the most influential musicians of the all time. Stretching rock music’s boundaries in the 70’s with hits like ‘Space Oddity’, ‘Changes’ and ‘Suffragette City’, he sold some 140 million albums worldwide.One of the first artists to go online, he has a thriving web community.Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, he received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2006.The iconic British singer-songwriter is currently the subject of a touring exhibition featuring hundreds of items including handwritten lyrics, costumes, photos, set designs and rare performance material from the past five decades. The show demonstrates how Bowie’s work has both influenced and been influenced by wider movements in art, design, theatre and contemporary culture and focuses on his creative processes, shifting style and collaboration with other artists. After London and Paris, the Bowie exhibition is currently running at the Groninger Museum in the Netherlands.","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/321021/210x136_321021.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df787413b36bc3748631a89","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

They don’t come easy to me. In the old days, when I was with The Faces and my solo albums, it was more like being at school doing homework but actually now I enjoy the process. It’s something, I think, that has come with age.”While the trademark spiky hairdo and raspy voice remain unchanged, Stewart says his album is varied and includes some nostalgic songs inspired by very personal memories: “‘Another Country’ is – you know, I try to put myself in a position of being a soldier sent abroad, who’s got a wife and children and misses them badly. And there’s another one, ‘A Way Back Home’, which although I wasn’t around, it’s songs, it’s memories I’ve garnered from my brothers and sisters and my parents about what London was like after the war.”With a series of Las Vegas and European gigs lined up, the legendary rocker says he has no plans to retire yet and is dreaming of taking to the stage in Glastonbury next summer with his band.‘Another Country’ is out now.","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/316381/210x136_316381.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df787413b36bc3748631a89","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

In ‘Rock the Kasbah’, he plays a washed up rock manager who takes his last client on a tour of Afghanistan to sing pop hits for US troops in Kabul. Zooey Deschanel plays the pop singer. Her husband Jacob Pechenik produced the film, which was directed by Barry Levinson, best known for ‘Good Morning, Vietnam’ and multiple-Oscar winner ‘Rain Man’. At the premiere in New York, which drew a host of celebrities including Lady Gaga, whose fiance Taylor Kinney plays in the movie, Murray said they really pushed the boundaries to get the best out of the script: “I haven’t felt this way about a movie in a very long time. I haven’t felt this way in a long time – that something unusual was happening, that we were really jumping over what was written and what was expected, making something much better than what we walked into at 6 o’clock in the morning.”Once in Kabul, the pop singer robs the rock manager and flees to the relative safety of Dubai. He is left alone in Kabul, in debt to a deranged mercenary played by Bruce Willis. On the red carpet in New York, Willis explained what he enjoyed about working with Murray: “Because he always changes up his comedy. He has about 17 comedy styles and he brought them all in this film and it’s just really fun.”Kate Hudson, who plays a prostitute who befriends Murray’s character, says she was nervous about working with him: “I always get a little nervous before movies anyway. But then you work with someone like Bill Murray and you definitely start thinking of all the work that you’ve admired for so long, you know, I wanted to have good chemistry with him and stuff so… but it was amazing. It was such a great, such a great experience.”As he waits for his new passport, Murray’s manager discovers a teenage girl with an extraordinary voice and takes her to compete in a popular TV show. The movie is inspired by true events from Afghanistan, where a candidate chose to sing in a reality TV contest despite death threats. Described as a pretty implausible feel-good movie, the film has garnered luke-warm reviews with one critic slamming it as a dreadfully misguided farce. ‘Rock the Kasbah’, starring Bill Murray, Bruce Willis and Kate Hudson, is on global release from now.","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/315667/210x136_315667.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df787413b36bc3748631a89","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

At a gig in London, we asked him about his unique slapping style – inspired by the traditional Japanese instrument called the Shamisen – which has earned him the nickname “samurai guitarist”.“As an Asian guitarist I just wanted to find my distinct style so I just started slapping the strings. And then with the drummer, Bobo, only two people on stage, it’s simpler and solid. It’s a really kind of intense performance, so, more freedom and a low budget!,” he said about his stripped down band of two.Miyavi’s latest album ‘The Others’ was produced by Grammy-winning producers Drew and Shannon. Much of it was recorded in Nashville and the artist says the spirit of the country music capital definitely wore off on his work: “I feel the vibes – to me it’s a spiritual spot. Every time I go to Nashville, I always pray, in just the normal streets, with cars passing by.”Fans at a recent London concert were thrilled to see their idol on stage. “The first time I saw him it was amazing, a big surprise for me. I have never seen him playing that kind of a guitar, it was just fantastic,” said one enthusiastic fan. “He is just an amazing human being and it really comes across in his music and everything he does, he makes everyone happy, and the world needs that, the world really needs that and Miyavi is that person,” said another. The EU-leg of Miyavi’s ‘We are the Others’ world tour ends in Helsinki this month.

We’re like furry little pagans wandering around .Formed by Haines and Jimmy Shaw in 1998, they were later joined by Josh Winstead on bass guitar and Joules Scott-Key on the drums. They are fresh from a 40-date tour with Imagine Dragons, an experience that fully immersed them in the mainstream music scene. “ I think we’ve always skirted around the mainstream,” admits Haines. “We’ve played with Muse, we’ve played with The Stones, we’ve played with Paramore, we’ve played in and around but this was like no. These guys were mainstream, really sweet people who made a big point every night of saying to the audience, ‘You should know who Metric is, we grew up on their music which was really kind and was really cool to be invited , it was very personal”Pagans in Vegas is out now, along with single The Shade.To get a taste of Metric’s acoustic side, fans will have to wait for their next release which is scheduled for 2016.","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/314261/210x136_314261.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df787413b36bc3748631a89","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

The 17-year-old has made the announcement that her 2020 world tour will be consciously acting against global warming.The Los Angeles born artist, with nearly 40 million Instagram followers and counting, revealed the news on US talk show Jimmy Fallon a few days ago. She described her ‘Where do we go’ tour as aiming to be “as green as possible”, explaining that she is collaborating with non-profit, arts organisation Reverb to achieve this. Reverb, in her own words, specialises in “the best and most healthy, green ways to do everything,” by educating and engaging musicians and their fans to promote environmental sustainability.She went on to specify more details about the 2020 tour, starting next March, stating:“There will be no plastic straws allowed, the fans are going to bring their own water bottles. There’s going to be recycled cans everywhere, because it’s like, if something’s recyclable - it doesn’t matter unless there’s a recycle bin.”cпасибоA post shared by  BILLIE EILISH (@billieeilish) on Aug 28, 2019 at 3:18pm PDTBut that’s not all. The artist, whose ethereal, melancholic album “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” reached 194 million streams in its first week, is even building a ‘Billie Eilish Eco-Village’ to travel around on tour with her across the globe. Set to perform in countries from Mexico to Germany in 2020, fans will be able to visit the eco-village and learn more about how to live more sustainably, in aid of the climate emergency.Her Jimmy Fallon appearance was accompanied by a video, initially shared on Instagram, now trending top on Youtube with over 3.6 million views. The video is entitled ‘Our House Is On Fire’, after Greta Thunberg’s now famous speech which silenced a room full of global leaders at Davos 2019 earlier this year.In the video, Billie appears alongside actor Woody Harrelson, speaking earnestly about the damage we are inflicting on the planet. She begins, “our earth is warming up and our oceans are rising. We cannot let this happen on our watch.”“Millions of people around the world are taking to the streets on a climate strike, demanding our leaders listen to the science and act,” she asserts, before encouraging her audience to do everything in their power to make a difference. For instance, “cutting out meat and dairy from your diet and reducing plastic use.” Both Billie and Woody also endorse Greenpeace and Fridays for Future, citing them as reliable sources of climate information and action.According to a study conducted in 2010, the age of digitisation in the music industry has made a positive impact on the environment. Through comparing music delivery methods, the study found that \"purchasing music digitally reduces the energy and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions associated with delivering music to customers [in the form of hard copy CDs] by between 40% and 80%.\" The streaming era has brought with it a reduction in plastic use due to less packaging. However, not everyone agrees the shift is worth it. Kyle Devine's new book 'Decomposed: The Political Ecology of Music' questions the environmentally-friendly assumption of the streaming industry, pointing out that the energy used to power online music listening may in fact be inflicting greater harm. According to Science news platform Phys.org, \"storing and processing music in the cloud depends on vast data centres that use a tremendous amount of resources and energy.\"When it comes to artists on tour, the first thing that comes to mind is the environmental cost of flying. However, despite the plane-shaming culture nowadays, flying is rarely limited in the industry given that big artists are increasingly reliant on live shows for income. \"This makes the cost of environmentally-friendly measures, such as squeezing fewer dates into a tour, harder to bear\", reported Crack Magazine in 2018. This is perhaps one indisputably damaging effect of touring.A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce) on Sep 15, 2018 at 8:11pm PDTJulie's Bicycle, a non-profit organisation based in London, compiled an in-depth study back in 2010 to address the issue, entitled 'Moving Arts: managing the carbon impacts of our touring: Bands, Orchestras and Theatre.' The aim was to pave the way for bands, orchestras and theatre tours by helping them to put the environment at the heart of tour production planning. Unfortunately, similar studies have not been conducted en masse in recent years.Clara Goldsmith however, Campaign Director at the Climate Coalition, supports Billie Eilish in her efforts, telling Euronews Living:  \"The Climate Coalition welcomes Billie Eilish's pledge to reduce the environmental impact of her world tour and to make her concerts a place where people can talk about climate change. This announcement sends a signal to both the public, and to politicians, that demand for climate action is growing.\"Share this article","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/19/81/48/210x136_cmsv2_69e35d5f-1982-5b4d-9f1f-a01730c8e4a4-4198148.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df787463b36bc3748631a8a","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

Impressively, the American singer-songwriter is one of just five artists to have reached over 1 billion views on a single music video on Youtube (‘Look what you made me do’) and is setting her sights just as high with her upcoming album Lover.The star has announced that her new album, to be released on August 23rd, will also mark the start of a collaboration with British designer Stella McCartney, whom Swift counts as a friend. The album, Lover, will go hand in hand with the launch of a new fashion collection with the sustainable fashion designer who the singer publicly advocates, by wearing her designs to events and awards ceremonies.Having dropped hints for the last few months that something exciting was in the mix, Taylor Swift took to Instagram to announce the launch of her new clothing collection. During a 10 minute Instagram Live, the 29 year old excitedly spilled the beans to her fans, saying:\"For the release of the Lover album there's gonna be a collaboration that I've done with Stella McCartney.

McCartney’s designs are cruelty-free and environmentally friendly, exclusively using organic cotton, sustainable viscose forest fibres, regenerated and recycled cashmere in all her collections. Stella McCartney even powers her offices and shops using green energy.A post shared by Stella McCartney (@stellamccartney) on Apr 24, 2019 at 10:08am PDTWe’re optimistic about the collaboration, as it will give Taylor Swift’s younger fan base a chance to learn more about sustainable fashion and in turn be conscious of the clothes they are buying.Share this article","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/97/86/62/210x136_cmsv2_fc5be4a0-fec0-5e94-a109-eaf1d00dda70-3978662.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df787463b36bc3748631a8a","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

The Fenty maison is likely going to be presented later this month in Paris and will consist of both a ready-to-wear collection and accessories including shoes, sunglasses and jewellery.Her unveiled brand logo features a Greek key design, with the name in white letters against a blue background and a reversed “N” in Fenty.LVMH Chairman and Chief Executive Bernard Arnault sung her praises in a statement saying,“Everybody knows Rihanna as a wonderful singer, but through our partnership at Fenty Beauty, I discovered a true entrepreneur, a real C.E.O. and a terrific leader. She naturally finds her full place within LVMH [and] we have built a talented and multicultural team supported by the Group resources.”Rihanna is calling this a “special moment” in her career, eager to show her new collection to the world. She said in a statement,“Designing a line like this with LVMH is an incredibly special moment for us. Mr Arnault has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits. I couldn’t imagine a better partner both creatively and business-wise, and I’m ready for the world to see what we have built together.\"If that isn’t exciting enough, Fenty is to be the first fashion brand launched completely from scratch by LVMH, since the conception of Christian Lacroix in 1987.Words: Maeve CampbellShare this article","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/88/32/68/210x136_cmsv2_3b9f877c-97ba-5f5d-b606-42f998e75154-3883268.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df787463b36bc3748631a8a","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

Could it be something to do with Earth Day 2019? It's not all doom and gloom when it comes to the environment, there are plenty of uplifting stories in the news at the moment, never mind these amazing eco initiatives led by some big names.  American rapper Lil Dicky has collaborated with Leonardo DiCaprio to release a celebrity charity song in celebration of Earth Day 2019, and it’s really quite catchy. Nowadays, DiCaprio is better known for his environmental activism, so it comes as no surprise that he was heavily involved in the production the single, ‘We Love the Earth’.The all-star song is all about preserving planet earth and focuses on the theme of climate change through fun, animated visuals featuring a whole host of celebrity voices. The list includes pop superstars like Ariana Grande, Ed Sheeran, Sia and Justin Bieber, who all make a cameo appearance as animated animals, to sing one line of the song (Ariana Grande is a zebra).“We love the earth, it is our planet, we love the earth, it is our home” is the chorus and we guarantee it will be in your head for days - for better or for worse.  But aside from the song, there is also an accompanying website https://welovetheearth.org/ with simple and informative tips on how we can all help to preserve our natural resources, we recommend taking a look.Earth Day Network teamed up with twitter this year to release a special edition emoji called ‘earth is in our hands.’ Just as you’d expect, the emoji features planet earth being held up by a pair of hands and can only be ‘unlocked’ by using the hashtag #earthday on twitter. Earth Day Network will run the twitter emoji for 365 days in recognition of the urgency of the environmental challenges we face globally.It’s just a shame we can’t use it on every social media platform!Dutch Victoria’s Secret model and ambassador for Knot On My Planet, Doutzen Kroes, has launched a new campaign to honour Earth Day. Kroes joins the British sustainable accessories brand Bottletop to announce the #TOGETHERBAND campaign, selling ethically-produced friendship bands. Every friendship band comes in the colours of each of the UN Global Goals and the campaign hopes to engage over a billion people with the issue.The best part about these bands is that they are made from upcycled ocean plastic from Costa Rica and recycled steel from seized illegal firearm metal from El Salvador. As if that isn’t ethical enough, the production of the accessories generates skills for women working as artisans in Nepal.100% of profits go towards removing plastic from the ocean and for every band purchased, you receive a second band to share with a friend, helping to spread the environmental message far and wide.Doutzen Kroes says:“I grew up interested in conservation: we were conscious of the water and the plastic we used and we always ate from our own garden. But it was when I took my son on safari to Kenya and learned about the elephant poaching crisis that I knew I had to do something. For the first time in my life I felt that I had job with a purpose.”A post shared by #TOGETHERBAND (@togetherbandofficial) on Apr 22, 2019 at 8:59am PDTWords: Maeve CampbellShare this article","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/82/94/98/210x136_cmsv2_1725bdac-8f38-50ce-946d-28fae6e492a8-3829498.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df787463b36bc3748631a8a","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

I am so impressed.”Prince used to say that Paisley Park was representative of everything he was in a musical sense, and he always envisioned the complex being open to the public.

But hardly anyone does | View\n                  ","description":"We all think we'd do the right thing if someone was being sexually abused. But when the accused is a person we admire, many of us don't.","content":"Opinion piece by F. Diane BarthAfter every new revelation about a celebrity accused of sexual misconduct — especially those whose misdeeds have long been talked about— the public starts asking why nobody stopped them sooner.The question is particularly poignant following the Sundance screening of the Michael Jackson documentary \"Leaving Neverland\" and the release of the Lifetime documentary “Surviving R. Kelly.” The first, a four-hour look at both the stories of two accusers and the lifetime of emotional fallout that followed, are essentially new allegations to many viewers, though Jackson faced and was acquitted of similar charges during his lifetime. (His estate has strenuously denied both men's accounts.)The second adds context to what Chicago Tribune reporter Steve Johnson noted were “allegations of sexual abuse of women and girls by singer R. Kelly [that] have been part of the public record” for nearly 20 years. (Kelly, too, faced and was acquitted of sexual abuse charges and his representatives deny any accusations of illegal activity.)Here’s the thing: All of us think that we would do the right thing in these situations, were we made aware of people in our lives being sexually abused. But when the accused is a person we admire — whether a celebrity or a religious leader or a beloved member of the community — many, if not most, of us are equally likely to not do the right thing, if that means taking the side of the accuser over the accused.There are many reasons that we (as a society and as individuals) do not always take victims’ complaints seriously. One is denial — the inability or unwillingness to see something that appears obvious to others. Denial is a way that our brains try to protect us when someone we love hurts us.As a psychotherapist, I have worked with parents whose denial made it impossible for them to see that their partners were mistreating their children, and with adults who were still hurt by their parents’ failure to recognize what they suffered as children. Sometimes the parents in denial are themselves the adult survivors of abuse.All of this means that someone who was abused may simply not be able to recognize another’s cruelty and mistreatment.And there are a lot of folks in this category: According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, one third of women and one fourth of men have been found to have experienced some sort of interpersonal violence.Another reason, besides his celebrity and wealth, that Kelly’s victims were not taken seriously (until now) may have been that they were often young black women, a group whose voices have been historically muted. And, with Jackson, his alleged victims were all young boys, and research suggests that stereotypes about masculinity contribute to men and boys not coming forward and to people disbelieving them when they do. (Terry Crews, who was groped by an agent, has spoken about how men reacted more negatively to his reports of assault than women.)That said, neither gender nor race convinced people that the victims of college gymnastics coach Larry Nassar (given a life sentence in January, 2018 for sexually assaulting numerous young gymnasts under his care) were telling the truth. His victims had reported his behavior to the Michigan State athletics officials for more than two decades.But parents, university officials and other responsible adults in these youngsters’ lives often failed to recognize, hear, see or acknowledge what was happening, even continuing to take their children or athletes to Nassar for care.So how do we change the dynamic of disbelief that survivors face, and which discourages them from reporting?The first thing is that it’s important simply to take a stand against unacceptable behavior in general. You don’t have to — and in fact should not — become judge and jury: None of us want to destroy a potentially innocent person, or accept as automatically true any accusation. But you can (and should) advocate for the values in which you believe, and be aware of the social and personal dynamics that often lead people to believe and protect abusers rather than victims.Your job as someone's confidant is not to determine what’s true, but to affirm their right to have their feelings and to protect themselves.So, listen carefully to the accounts of people who are reporting mistreatment, as well as to those who are accused. Research has shown that abuse is often accompanied by forced or voluntary silence, and that acknowledging a victim’s feelings is extremely important to the healing process. And, on the other hand, Sarah Newman, the managing editor of PsychCentral and an abuse survivor, notes “Abusers don’t want you to trust your feelings. They tell you — maybe explicitly but definitely implicitly — that your feelings don’t matter.”It's also important to understand that both abusers and abused both tend to minimize the destructiveness of abusive behavior so, if someone you know is telling you of such behavior, you should emphasize that it is not acceptable. It is normal for an abuse victim to attempt to defend the very person they have just complained about, because they often feel dependent and vulnerable, and at the same time, protective.This is what the men in the Jackson documentary now describe as their motivation for testifying in his defense: Not only did he make them fear that they would be in trouble, but they would be the cause of his trouble, and they cared for him. Aishah Shahidah Simmons suggests the same might be true in the case of Whitney Houston, who, her brother alleged in the documentary “Whitney,” was abused by Dee Dee Warwick, the sister of the famous singer Dionne Warwick.If someone reports abuse to you, encourage them to seek professional counsel, both psychological and legal. Good help for victims of abuse is much easier to find than it was in the past but, if you do not know specifically where to send them in your community, you can start with the National Sexual Assault Hotline staffed by RAINN, the largest anti-sexual assault organization in the United States. They provide immediate and confidential support in English and Spanish and can help victims or their supporters find further assistance near where you live.Finally, though, understand that someone's accusation of abuse is not about you or your choices: You can love R. Kelly’s or Michael Jackson's music, Kevin Spacey’s acting or Bill Cosby’s humor, but you can also understand, affirm and recognize that a beloved person can do terrible harm. In fact, the more adored a person, the worse the damage he or she can do — not just to those who they abused, but to the society that allows them to get away with it.F.

Today is not that day.On paper, “Bohemian Rhapsody” seems like it should be a fantastic film. It has a complex and wildly talented genius, cut down before his time by a plague the homophobic Western world refused to take seriously. It has the music of Queen, which is still as fresh and thrilling as when it was first written. It has casting that ranged from impeccable to inspired in the case of Rami Malek.So what went wrong? How could the story of one of the most fascinating figures in rock music descend into a color-by-numbers tale more suitable for VH1 than the Academy Awards?The answer has a lot to do with the film’s origins. The project spent nearly a decade kicking around Hollywood, with Sacha Baron Cohen attached to play the singer back in 2010. Already recognized for his singing talent in “Sweeney Todd” and at the time getting ready to co-star in the film adaptation of “Les Misérables,” he seemed a perfect fit. But after three years and little progress, Cohen walked away from the part.The problem, as he explained it, stemmed from the keepers of Queen’s musical rights, Brian May and Roger Taylor. May and Taylor — Queen's guitarist and drummer, respectively — had a very different movie in mind, one where they were the main stars and Freddie’s ordeal was something they’d overcome on the way to even more greatness. The film then languished until Rami Malek was hired to take on the part of Mercury. But Malek clashed with the director Bryan Singer; one day Singer too walked off the set and never came back.\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" reduces Mercury to just another fallen rock and roller, with no grasp of what makes his story so triumphant and also so tragic.The movie was completed by the assistant directors, and thankfully it did not end up being totally filtered through the hazy memories of Mercury’s remaining bandmates. But that doesn’t mean it’s a great film, or even a good one. In the end, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" reduces Mercury to just another fallen rock and roller, with no grasp of what makes his story so triumphant and also so tragic.Take for instance the opening vignette, where Brian May and Roger Taylor are portrayed as two dudes in a perfectly good band who take on Mercury on of necessity. In subsequent scene after scene, with managers, lawyers and record executives, Taylor and May are seen politely sitting on the couch, sipping tea, while Mercury is portrayed as a difficult diva. Not that May and Taylor disagreed with Mercury's music — they knew enough to go along with his genius. (So did bassist John Deacon, who, unlike May and Taylor, is not listed as an executive producer of the film, perhaps explaining why he winds up as an afterthought in many scenes.) The result is a movie that feels desperate to portray Taylor and May as the steady, responsible musicians who tried (and failed) to save their friend from himself.This is tragic, because Malek is so good as Mercury. Like, career-defining good. Moreover, the rest of the cast does a great job in support of Malek. You will believe Gwilym Lee is Brian May’s younger self and Ben Hardy does a great job as Taylor’s egotistic counterpart to Mercury. Only Joseph Mazzello as Deacon doesn’t always come off as believable; once he loses the early 1970s wig, though, he improves enormously. And then of course, there’s the genius stunt casting of Mike Myers as the EMI record exec who insists long-haired hooligan teens won’t rock out to the song “Bohemian Rhapsody” in their cars, a perfect homage to 1992’s “Wayne’s World” use of the song.But the acting can’t hide the film’s substantial plot flaws. As Mercury descends into drugs and debauchery, the other band members are shown looking uncomfortable and confused. They are heterosexual foils to his free-loving free spirit.Speaking of which, the film’s issues with Mercury's sexuality are glaring. Early on, Mercury is shown to bemadly in love with a woman, Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton). She is portrayed as a stabilizing influence, and during their relationship Mercury's music is great. But once Mercury starts exploring his sexuality, he starts to slip. High and in the thrall of manager Paul Prenter (Allen Leech, playing very against his best known “Downton Abbey” role), Mercury makes a series of bad decisions culminating in Queen nearly missing out on the opportunity to perform at Live Aid. In other words, the film seems to suggest that gay clubs can lead to drugs which can lead to increasingly poor choices and, eventually, AIDS. Nancy Reagan would give this film the D.A.R.E. seal of approval.Even worse, the film leads with this plotline. Mercury is shown telling the band he has HIV one week before their Live Aid performance. Even for this genre, the historical revisionism feels particularly egregious, inserted to make the other bandmates seem compassionate, yet stoic. Live Aid happened in 1985, but Mercury was not believed to have been diagnosed until 1987. The movie attempts to insist his scene-stealing performance at Live Aid was a final hurrah of glory in the face of certain death. In truth, it was just Freddie being Freddie, doing his thing on stage.That the people behind this movie are too unimaginative to understand this simple fact encapsulates so many of the problems with the film. In re-staging the Live Aid performance in full (it takes up the final 20 minutes, the movie captures what made Mercury such an electric performer. But it also throws into sharp relief how little the rest of the film understood about what made him so special.Ani Bundel has been blogging professionally since 2010.

Since then, Garou has been awarded one diamond, and fifteen platinum records for hits like “Belle”, “Seul” and “Sous le Vent”, a duet performed with Celine Dion.He has also participated as a coach in several editions of The Voice in both Canada and France.Ahead of his performance in Dubai, Garou talked to Euronews about his ambition to one day incorporate Arabic beats into his music and spoke of how important it was to reach a new audience here in the UAE and beyond.You’re in Dubai to celebrate your 20 Year Tour Jubilee Tour and it’s your first-ever concert in Dubai. What can your fans expect?It’s the first time in Dubai, after 20 years, it’s like feeling like a kid again because I feel like a newcomer. The best thing for me in my career is to go to new places and discover new people and enjoy the energy of a new place and try to understand it, so I’m happy to be here.Now you’ll be playing a mixture of your classic tracks and some new material and you’ll be mixing them up with other music. Are you in any way worried that the fans will expect hear what they know and love?I know, I’m a little scared because I’m transforming some songs but I think it’s interesting and I believe that the fun we have on stage with the musicians should transcend to people.I’m a really big fan of Ray Charles, so there’s a Ray Charles medley that I incorporated in the show. And some new band like X Ambassadors, Goo Goo dolls that I integrate into my songs.Now you haven’t yet incorporated Arabic beats into your music. Could this be on the cards?It could be because I was editing some images that I took during a day of lots of activities and I was incorporating a song from Sting, Desert Rose, which is a fantastic mixture of cultures. I might give it a try at the show. We’ll do the rehearsal later on and try it. We never know!So this might be something that you might make into an album one day potentially? Can your fans expect new material with an Arabic twist?Honestly, yesterday I was having all this music in my head and listening to music and I think ithe best way to make people understand each other is by celebrating music. I think it’s the best way of communication. The proof is that I’ve had the chance, the great opportunity, to sing in French in many non-francophone countries and I see the smiles and the sparkles in the eyes. There’s a lot of love-sharing through music. So, I believe it would be the best way, to make an album with some Arabic artists.","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/39/55/14/210x136_cmsv2_2d0860b6-e126-5590-a6a3-43be7e1fd13f-3395514.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df787463b36bc3748631a8a","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

I think our songs fit into where we are at the moment.\"The band also have serious issues with Britain, over bombings and Brexit.  \"We're not quite at Hungary levels of suppression. I don't think we ever will be. I don't think it is the kind of country that would take that,\" said Lockey.\"But, saying that,\" he added, \"it's the same country that bombed Syria without any authorisation from parliament and is leading the country into its worst decision in generations.\"  Lockey is the guitarist behind the riff that gives power to 'the song 'Hallelujah (So Low)'. Editors frontman Tom Smith wrote the lyrics after a visit, with Oxfam, to a Syrian refugee camp in Greece. It resonates with the fans.  \"Tom had certain feelings about his trip and wrote some lyrics to go along, reflecting on those feelings,\" explained Editors drummer and founder Ed Lay.   \"And something quite magical happened when Justin came up with this huge guitar riff. It doesn't instantly relate to refugee camps but we capture the moment in that room and that's the way the best songs come out.\"'Darkness at the Door' is the third single from the album.  On tour, the new material has gone down well, even the latest more electronic songs.\"The new stuff, I think, is sounding mega,\" said Lay. \"It feels that people are really responding to it. \"Bringing Blanck Mass in was something that we have never done before. He's a really heavy electronic producer and something that we were listening to and thought could work very well with our brand of music. Luckily, he was up for it and we created some pretty decent results.\"  The Euronews-Editors chat came just a few days after the death of young Swedish DJ and producer Avicii, which has revived the debate about the pressure faced by artists in the music industry.  \"The pressures are there. The pressures are very real,\" said Lay. \"The temptation to alleviate that pressure by taking drink or drugs or doing things that are not necessarily the best for you, is always there, of course.\"  \"It is not suprising when you hear of musicians passing away young,\" Lockey added. \"The pressure and the mental health of musicians is something that is never talked about. It's something that is always brushed under the carpet because it is not very glamorous.

Highlighting the most international year for Latin music in history, major non-Latin music superstars like Justin Bieber, Beyoncé, and Pharrell Williams were nominated for their features in some of the genre’s biggest hits of the year.‘Despacito’ by Luis Fonsi featuring Daddy Yankee has over 5 billion views on YouTube, and the remix with Justin Bieber, over 500 million. The song dominated the award show winning six trophies: hot Latin song of the year, vocal event; airplay song of the year; digital song of the year; streaming song of the year; and Latin pop song of the year. A song that many say, revived global interest in Latin music.Daddy Yankee who was featured in the original and the remix of the song, as well co-writer, went home with eight awards. To be brief, Yankee won Latin rhythm artist of the year, solo, and songwriter of the year for “Despacito” as well as several others.Justin Bieber who was featured in the song's remix, took home seven awards, including crossover artist of the year, beating Beyoncé, Little Mix, and Ed Sheeran.The explosion of Latin tracks continued after ‘Despacito’. J Balvin’s ‘Mi Gente’ hit featuring Willy Wiliam with 1.5 billion plays on YouTube, was later remixed after its release by the queen herself, Beyoncé.Other artists such as Ozuna, from Puerto Rico, who won artist of the year, performed ‘La Modelo’ with New York native Cardi B. Nicky Jam, who won top Latin album of the year, also performed last night. Other star turns came from Malema, Ricky Martin, and J Balvin, and Karol G.The rise of Latin music comes after a recent introduction of new sounds, specifically ‘trap’, a sound that dates back to the 1980s from an analogue drum machine. The beats are unique, with a sound that is full of short bursts, at a rapid-fire speed—faster than any human could play.The trap sound adds new flavour to the already diverse genre of Latin music. The classic reggaeton sound has morphed into a combination, of rap, pop, trap and even dance music.Artists like the Bad Bunny or as he’s known by Latino’s, ‘El Conejo Malo’, from Puerto Rico have mastered this new sound of trap—and the numbers speak for themselves. Bad Bunny teamed up with American Becky G last year for ‘Mayores’, a Latin pop mix of cumbia and reggaeton that reached over 1 billion views on YouTube as well.J Balvin and Shakira, both from Colombia topped the nominations list with 12 nominations apiece, with Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee, Maluma, and Ozuna with 10 each.With just over a month until the World Cup, Telemundo Deportes, in honour of the most anticipated event, announced their world premiere 2018 official World Cup song.Colombian artist J Balvin will sing along to the sound of football, teaming up with Haitian DJ, Michael Brun, to go down in history this summer.The Spanish network will use this song on its channel during the tournament.Here’s the official teaser to what will soon be one of the most played songs of the summer.","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/13/89/52/210x136_cmsv2_d04b64d6-93cf-5c6b-a3f3-f203f94e493e-3138952.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df787463b36bc3748631a8a","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

Out of the industrial gloom of Northern England came one of Britain's most influential bands. Bass player Peter Hook recounted their career in the biography of Joy Division, but he also took Euronews back to the day it all began.\"I do remember it very well. We had much trouble with our name towards the end of the year before. There was a group in London called Warsaw Packt and it meant that we had to change our name.\"\"Ian Curtis was reading a book called 'The House of Dolls' and he picked the name from that book, which was Joy Division.\"\"We were scheduled to play at Pips as Warsaw and we had to change it in the last minute to Joy Division which didn't help our dwindling audience figures.\"\"Mostly the people that were there that night were our friends. Because our friends, let us say, were very colourful characters it ended all in a massive fight.\"\"Ian Curtis himself actually got thrown out of the venue for kicking glass on the floor. A doorman, the security, took great exception and threw him out. We had to go beg to get him back in.\"\"So by the time we came to play the concert we were very very nervous and shellshocked shall we say.\"\"Hopefully it will carry on and I think its a great compliment to all the members of Joy Division that we are still as popular or miles more popular than we were on that 25th January (1978) when we played at Pips.\" The group became a bridge point between Punk in the mid-70s and the rise of more \"mainstream\" electronic music in the following decade. And their popularity stood the test of time, continuing to gain fans among younger audiences.For about eight years, Peter Hook has played in a new band called 'The Light', bringing the music of Joy Division back to the stage, something 'New Order', the band that became the group after the suicide of Ian Curtis May 18, 1980, had never done. The success and celebration continues.This year, they go on tour across the United States. In June they return to the British stage and in September Peter & the Light will be in Germany.\"It's a way to continue to pay tribute to Ian\".","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/06/47/32/210x136_story-3c275246-8378-51d7-89bb-1238ff18512b_197880.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df787463b36bc3748631a8a","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

Me three.Trade relations, heading down the swanny.If it doesn't fit on the side of a bus, let's not say it, don't make a fuss.Phase one was a floundering mess, the Prime Minister said she did her best.The Irish border was the sticking point and the DUP.Cross-border trade we're told is possible, it's about wording, you see.A fudge not a dodge, and has the Right Honourable lady for Maidenhead really lost the thread?The Brexit spool unravels, our economy headed south.And what about travel?Blue passports we're told, ah perfect, imported they'll be.That's me, I'm sold.Choose Brexit, choose a new queue, at the airport we'll be going through.It's for the next generation of children I fear, Erasmus, international trade,travel will be lost, I shed a tear.LGBT rights, workers' rights, equal pay, all important things the EU has paved the way.On the night of the referendum and then the next day, promises were made, they were dead straight away.How will history judge our politicians of today? All of us here, not well I say.Not all of us want to be facing this mess,in Scotland we voted to stay in, we think it's for the best.So let's get together and stop this guddle, for the sake of our future, we need out of this Brexit muddle.","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/05/05/33/210x136_story-aabb0bc9-2a1b-5735-af76-7854452b06c7_129712.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df787463b36bc3748631a8a","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}

Terrible, horrible loss.”His mother, Lesley, died from cancer in 1997, shortly after the death of his partner and “first love” Anselmo Feleppa in 1993 from HIV/AIDS related illness, which left the singer distraught. “He, still, 23 years later, brings a tear to my eye. He was my saviour,” Michael says in the footage.He also recalled feeling overwhelmed with sadness while performing at the 1992 tribute concert for Freddie Mercury, often hailed as his greatest live performance, with Feleppa in the audience. “I went out there knowing I had to honour Freddie Mercury and I had to pray for Anselmo. I wanted to die inside.”The documentary, co-directed by Michael and initially planned as a promotional film for the re-issue of his 1990 album Listen Without Prejudice Vol 1, ended up being the last thing he worked on. Featuring rich tributes from a star cast of musicians and TV personalities including Stevie Wonder, Elton John, Mary J Blige, Liam Gallagher, Nile Rodgers, Ricky Gervais and James Corden, the film charts Michael’s journey through super stardom in the 1980s and his many professional and personal battles including taking on his record label Sony and coming out as gay.“Ultimately the whole thing was a complete waste of time. And I regret it to this day,” Michael says of his court case with Sony to end his “unfair” contract, which he lost in 1994. He also felt let down by fellow musicians: “I can’t think of one person that supported me.”The film is introduced by British supermodel Kate Moss who featured in Michael’s 2012 video White Light : “Only days before [his death] he was putting the finishing touches to the film you’re about to see. This is George’s film Freedom and it’s his final work.” A cover of Fastlove sung by Adele and a Chris Martin ‘duet’ of A Different Corner are also heard over the opening and closing credits respectively.It ends on a poignant note with Michael asked how he would like to be remembered: “A great singer songwriter from a period that I don’t think we will be seeing again (with people like myself, Madonna and Prince). But really it’s just the songs and I hope people think of me as someone who had some kind of integrity.”BBC Worldwide will make the film available to broadcasters around the world and the US premiere will air on Showtime on October 21.The box set re-issue of Michael’s Listen Without Prejudice album will be released on October 20 and will include his 1996 MTV Unplugged performance.By Subhajit Banerjee","imageUrl":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/394011/210x136_394011.jpg","rating":{"$numberInt":"0"},"isApproved":true,"viewCount":{"$numberInt":"0"},"category":"5df787463b36bc3748631a8a","createdAt":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1035716400000"}}}
